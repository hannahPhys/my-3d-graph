aliases: AdS/CFT correspondence
---

The AdS/CFT correspondence, or Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality, is a conjecture in theoretical physics that has been influential in the development of [[String theory]]. It was first proposed by Juan Maldacena, a theoretical physicist, in 1997.

This correspondence provides a relationship between two different kinds of physical theories: a [[gravity]] theory in a certain kind of [[negative curvature]] ("Anti-de Sitter" or AdS) space, and a [[Quantum Field Theory]] defined on the boundary of that space, a Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Essentially, it states that [[String theory]] in an AdS space is equivalent to a CFT defined on the boundary of that space.

What's particularly striking about this is the difference in dimensions between the two sides of the correspondence: the AdS side is a gravity theory in a higher-[[dimensional]] space, while the CFT side is a quantum field theory in one fewer dimension. This realization has led to a deeper understanding of the [[holographic principle]], a concept suggesting that all the information in a volume of space can be represented as information on a boundary of that space.

The AdS/CFT correspondence has proved to be an extremely useful tool in theoretical physics. It allows for a concrete realization of the [[holographic principle]], and provides a framework where [[quantum gravity]] can be studied using the tools of [[Quantum Field Theory]]. However, it's worth noting that while the correspondence has been tested in numerous ways and has many successful checks, it still remains a conjecture, as it hasn't been proven rigorously.
