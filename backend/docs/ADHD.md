There are ongoing studies and research on ADHD, and new findings are constantly emerging. Some recent findings include:

1. Environmental factors: Research suggests that environmental factors, such as exposure to toxins, may play a role in the development of ADHD.

2. Genetic factors: Recent studies have identified specific genes that may be linked to ADHD. For example, a study published in 2020 found that mutations in the DCLK1 gene were associated with an increased risk of ADHD.

3. Brain development: Studies have shown that children with ADHD may have delays in the development of certain areas of the brain, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is responsible for executive function.

4. Gut microbiome: Some studies have found that disruptions in the gut microbiome may be associated with ADHD. For example, a study published in 2021 found that children with ADHD had lower levels of certain types of gut bacteria compared to children without ADHD.

There is some evidence to suggest that [[FAAH]] production may be insufficient in the brains of individuals with ADHD, leading to the accumulation of [[anandamide]] and a subsequent [[dopamine deficiency]]. [[anandamide]] is known to play a role in [[dopamine]] release and regulation, and its accumulation may disrupt normal dopamine signaling in the brain, which has been implicated in ADHD. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between FAAH, anandamide, dopamine, and ADHD. [[unknown]]

[[CBD]] on the other hand, can modulate [[GABA]] activity. [[GABA]] is a neurotransmitter responsible for reducing [[neuronal excitability]], and when inhibited, [[dopamine]] production increases. [[CBD]] also stimulates adenosine receptors, encouraging dopamine release. 


The activity of fatty acid amide hydrolyse ([[FAAH]]), which is responsible for AEA degradation, was significantly decreased in lymphocytes from peripheral blood of subjects with ADHD. This finding suggests that AEA catabolism is dysregulated in ADHD, whereas the synthesis of AEA was unaltered.Â Stimulation of dopamine (DA) D2 class receptors inhibits [[FAAH]] activity and increases the level of AEA in the brain. A complex interaction between DA and the AEA endocannabinoid system (ECS) is found experimentally, and ECS is implicated in other DA-related disorders such as Parkinsonism. Dysfunction of the dopamine system is proposed to explain the clinical manifestations of ADHD.The [[endocannabinoid system]] plays an important role in brain development and [[anandamide]] (arachidonylethanolamide [AEA]) impairs [[memory]] and attention by reducing the activity of the dopamine transporter system.
