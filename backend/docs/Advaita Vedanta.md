Advaita Vedanta is a philosophical and spiritual tradition rooted in the ancient scriptures of India, particularly in the Vedas and Upanishads. "Advaita" means "non-dual" in Sanskrit, and Advaita Vedanta is often referred to as the philosophy of non-dualism. It was formulated and popularized by the philosopher and theologian Adi Shankaracharya in the early 8th century.

Key Concepts of Advaita Vedanta:

1. **Non-Dualism ([[Advaita]]):** At the heart of Advaita Vedanta is the concept of non-dualism, which asserts that there is an ultimate reality that is unchanging, indivisible, and beyond the realm of duality. This ultimate reality is often referred to as Brahman. atman = brahman schrodinbger 2nd euation

2. **[[Brahman]]:** Brahman is considered the ultimate reality or cosmic consciousness. It is described as formless, infinite, and beyond all attributes. According to Advaita Vedanta, everything in the universe is an expression or manifestation of Brahman.

3. **Atman:** Atman refers to the individual self or soul. Advaita Vedanta teaches that the true nature of the individual Atman is identical to Brahman. In other words, the individual soul and the cosmic reality are fundamentally one and the same.

4. **Maya:** Maya is the concept of illusion or the power that creates the appearance of duality in the world. It is the force that makes us perceive multiplicity and separation, while the ultimate reality is non-dual.

5. **Jiva and Jivanmukta:** Jiva refers to the individual soul, while Jivanmukta refers to one who has attained liberation while still alive. In Advaita Vedanta, the realization of the non-dual nature of reality leads to liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).

6. **Self-Realization (Jnana):** Advaita Vedanta emphasizes self-realization through direct insight (jnana) into the nature of reality. This realization comes from understanding the unity of Atman and Brahman and transcending the illusion of duality.

7. **Scriptural Authority:** While emphasizing direct realization, Advaita Vedanta also acknowledges the importance of scriptures as a means to guide seekers and provide teachings on the nature of reality.

Advaita Vedanta has had a profound influence on Hindu philosophy, spirituality, and mysticism. It has also attracted the attention of scholars and seekers worldwide due to its emphasis on the unity of all existence and its exploration of the nature of reality beyond conventional dualistic perceptions.
