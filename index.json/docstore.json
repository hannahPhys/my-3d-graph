For example, a study published in 2020 found that mutations in the DCLK1 gene were associated with an increased risk of ADHD.\n\n3. Brain development: Studies have shown that children with ADHD may have delays in the development of certain areas of the brain, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is responsible for executive function.\n\n4.

For example, a study published in 2021 found that children with ADHD had lower levels of certain types of gut bacteria compared to children without ADHD.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that [[FAAH]] production may be insufficient in the brains of individuals with ADHD, leading to the accumulation of [[anandamide]] and a subsequent [[dopamine deficiency]]. [[anandamide]] is known to play a role in [[dopamine]] release and regulation, and its accumulation may disrupt normal dopamine signaling in the brain, which has been implicated in ADHD.

It was formulated and popularized by the philosopher and theologian Adi Shankaracharya in the early 8th century.\n\nKey Concepts of Advaita Vedanta:\n\n1. **Non-Dualism ([[Advaita]]):** At the heart of Advaita Vedanta is the concept of non-dualism, which asserts that there is an ultimate reality that is unchanging, indivisible, and beyond the realm of duality. This ultimate reality is often referred to as Brahman. atman = brahman schrodinbger 2nd euation\n\n2. **[[Brahman]]:** Brahman is considered the ultimate reality or cosmic consciousness. It is described as formless, infinite, and beyond all attributes. According to Advaita Vedanta, everything in the universe is an expression or manifestation of Brahman.\n\n3. **Atman:** Atman refers to the individual self or soul. Advaita Vedanta teaches that the true nature of the individual Atman is identical to Brahman. In other words, the individual soul and the cosmic reality are fundamentally one and the same.\n\n4. **Maya:** Maya is the concept of illusion or the power that creates the appearance of duality in the world. It is the force that makes us perceive multiplicity and separation, while the ultimate reality is non-dual.\n\n5. **Jiva and Jivanmukta:** Jiva refers to the individual soul, while Jivanmukta refers to one who has attained liberation while still alive. In Advaita Vedanta, the realization of the non-dual nature of reality leads to liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).\n\n6. **Self-Realization (Jnana):** Advaita Vedanta emphasizes self-realization through direct insight (jnana) into the nature of reality. This realization comes from understanding the unity of Atman and Brahman and transcending the illusion of duality.\n\n7. **Scriptural Authority:** While emphasizing direct realization, Advaita Vedanta also acknowledges the importance of scriptures as a means to guide seekers and provide teachings on the nature of reality.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta has had a profound influence on Hindu philosophy, spirituality, and mysticism. It has also attracted the attention of scholars and seekers worldwide due to its emphasis on the unity of all existence and its exploration of the nature of reality beyond conventional dualistic perceptions.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0d51079fd4409b1ca5ea266e9cca3f8742461748cf74e4d64de8d0bcddf6424d", "text": "The Alcubierre warp drive is a speculative idea based on a solution to Einstein's field equations in [[general relativity]]. It was proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. The warp drive concept is named after Alcubierre's proposal, which involves a spacecraft achieving apparent superluminal travel (faster-than-light travel) by creating a bubble of [[negative energy]] density around it. \n\nThe core idea is that, while [[special relativity]] forbids objects from moving faster than light within spacetime, it is known that spacetime itself can be manipulated in ways that allows an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant [[observation|observer]]. \n\nThe Alcubierre drive concept involves distorting spacetime in such a way that it expands behind the spacecraft and contracts in front of it. If you imagine the spacecraft at rest in a small flat region of spacetime (the \"warp bubble\"), then this distortion moves the warp bubble as desired, and inside it the spacecraft can move towards its destination at conventional sub-light speeds, but when seen from outside, the destination and origin points are brought close together by the warp of the spacetime, effectively achieving superluminal travel.\n\nHowever, there are several substantial hurdles to the concept. For one, the Alcubierre drive requires negative energy densities, which have not been proven to exist. Secondly, the amounts of energy required for such a propulsion are estimated to be on the order of the mass-energy of a whole planet, if not more. There are also potential issues related to [[causality]], [[Quantum Field Theory]] in curved spacetime, and high-energy particle radiation.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Alcubierre warp drive remains a topic of interest because it's one of the few solutions to the equations of [[general relativity]] that allow for faster-than-light travel without the need for exotic matter with negative mass.

However, in LQG, spacetime is [[quantization|quantized]], meaning it is represented by [[discrete]] and granular structures rather than a continuous manifold. To describe the quantum properties of spacetime, the Ashtekar variables provide an alternative set of variables that are more suitable for quantization. \n\nThe key idea behind the Ashtekar variables is to express the gravitational field in terms of a [[connection]], known as the Ashtekar connection, and its [[conjugate]] [[momentum]], called the densitized triad. These variables have a direct correspondence with the metric and its canonical momentum in general relativity. ([[Canonical Commutation Relation]])\n\nThe Ashtekar connection captures the notion of curvature of spacetime, and the densitized triad describes the spatial [[geometry]]. Together, they provide a geometric and kinematical description of the gravitational field. By using these variables, one can construct a quantum theory of gravity in the framework of LQG.\n\nThe Ashtekar variables have played a crucial role in the development of [[loop quantum gravity]] and have provided insights into the quantum nature of spacetime. They have been used to derive important results, such as the quantization of area and volume, and have contributed to ongoing efforts to understand the behavior of matter and geometry at the smallest scales of spacetime.\n\nIt's important to note that loop quantum gravity and the use of Ashtekar variables are active areas of research, and the theory is still being developed and refined.

In assembly theory, what traditional physics considers \"emergent\" becomes fundamental. The \"emergent-ness\" of an object is a function of its depth in time, offering a new lens through which to view phenomena like the origins of life, intelligence, and consciousness.\n\n  \nIn classical physics, time has often been considered as either a constant backdrop (Newton) or a relative illusion (Einstein). Even in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, time is generally considered an emergent property, not a fundamental one. However, assembly theory posits that time is not just a stage on which events happen but is intrinsically tied to the material fabric of the universe. It suggests that time has a physical size, much like space, and can be measured at a molecular level.\n\nThe theory introduces the concept of \"Assembly,\" a measure that combines an object's complexity (assembly index) and its abundance (copy number). This Assembly measure serves as an indicator of an object's \"depth in time,\" showing how much \"local memory\" is required for its existence. Local memory is essentially the information needed to construct an object, and it increases with the object's complexity. The theory argues that objects with high Assembly values could only have been produced by evolutionary processes, making Assembly a potential universal life-detection system.\n\nAssembly theory also tackles the concept of \"emergence,\" often used to describe phenomena that can't be predicted from their constituent parts, like the wetness of water from individual molecules. In this framework, what is considered \"emergent\" is actually fundamental but lies deep in time, requiring a long chain of selection and memory to exist.\n\nThe article also delves into the philosophical implications of making time a material property. It suggests that the universe is expanding in time rather than space, and although it may be deterministic, its future is open-ended due to its expansion in time. This re-conceptualization of time could potentially solve many open problems in physics, including the debate between determinism and contingency.\n\nIn summary, assembly theory offers a radical rethinking of time, making it a material property and linking it intrinsically to the process of evolution and the complexity of objects.

To understand it, let's break down the relevant concepts:\n\n1. **Entropy**: In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the number of possible states that a system can be in. It's often thought of as a measure of disorder or randomness. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system can never decrease; it can only stay the same or increase.\n\n2. **Black Holes**: A [[black hole]] is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The boundary of a black hole, known as the [[event horizon]], is the point of no return beyond which anything that enters cannot escape.\n\nNow, let's put these two ideas together:\n\n3. **Black Hole Entropy**: [[black hole]] entropy is a concept that was first suggested by physicist Jacob Bekenstein and further developed by Stephen Hawking. Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that this entropy should be proportional to the area of its event horizon.\n\nThis was a revolutionary idea. In normal physical systems, entropy is proportional to volume, because the larger the volume, the more states the system can be in. However, for a black hole, Bekenstein proposed that the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.\n\n4. **[[Hawking Radiation]] and Black Hole Thermodynamics**: Stephen Hawking further expanded this concept by proposing that black holes aren't entirely black but can emit what's now known as Hawking Radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This was groundbreaking as it suggested black holes could lose mass (and thus energy) over [[Time]], eventually evaporating completely.\n\nHawking's proposal led to the formulation of the four laws of black hole mechanics, which are analogous to the four [[laws of thermodynamics]], with the black hole entropy playing a role similar to that of entropy in thermodynamics.\n\nOne of the surprising consequences of this relationship is the [[holographic principle]], which was suggested by the realization that black hole entropy is proportional to its surface area (not its volume), indicating that information about everything inside could be encoded on the surface.\n\nHowever, there are still open questions and problems to solve, such as the [[black hole information paradox]], which questions what happens to information about the state of things that have fallen into a black hole.

A [[stream]] of electrons. \n\nBohm proposed that this collective behavior could be understood through a new concept he called \"[[plasma oscillations]].\" He suggested that the electrons in a plasma could be seen as vibrating together in a coordinated manner, giving rise to a collective wave-like motion. This [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] and coordination of the electrons in the plasma were seen as analogous to the behavior of particles in a quantum system.\n\nThis early work on plasmas influenced Bohm's later development of his theory of the [[implicate and explicate order]] where he extended the idea of interconnectedness to the fundamental nature of reality. He proposed that the [[universe]] is fundamentally enfolded in an underlying order, the implicate order, where everything is interconnected and enfolded into a unified whole. The explicate order, on the other hand, represents the unfolded or [[manifested]] aspects of reality that we observe in our everyday experience. Bohm viewed the two orders as different aspects or dimensions of reality, with a constant flow and movement from one to the other. \n\nIn relation to **[[Consciousness]]**, Bohm proposed that the mind and matter are not separate but are two aspects of one whole and unbroken movement. The implicate order applies to all matter, including the [[neuron|neurons]] in our brains, as well as to consciousness. This suggests a deep connection between the mind and the physical world, which reflects some ideas of Eastern philosophy.\n\nBohm also proposed the notion of a [[super-implicate order]], which is another level of reality even deeper than the implicate order, and which could possibly be linked to the source of creativity and [[Consciousness]]. \n\nBoth matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment. For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in spacetime.

This phenomenon is called \"Bose-Einstein condensation.\"\n- The bosons act as a single entity with quantum properties, where the wave functions of individual atoms overlap and become coherent.\n\n**Properties of BEC:**\n- Superfluidity: BECs can flow without viscosity. This means they can flow over the edges of a container and remain motionless because there is no friction.\n- Macroscopic Quantum Phenomena: Properties that are typically only observable on the scale of individual particles, like wave-particle duality, become apparent on a scale that can be seen and manipulated.\n- Quantum Coherence: The particles within a BEC exhibit a high degree of coherence, behaving more like waves than particles, with a well-defined phase relationship.\n\n**Experimental Realization:**\n- The first BEC was created in 1995 by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder, using a gas of rubidium atoms. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001 for their achievement.\n- Creating a BEC is a complex process that involves using a combination of laser cooling and magnetic or optical trapping to reduce the temperature of a cloud of atoms.\n\n**Applications:**\n- BECs provide a unique environment to study quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level and have potential applications in various fields, including quantum computing, precision measurement, and understanding fundamental physics.\n- They are used to simulate conditions that might exist in black holes and neutron stars, and to create atom lasers, which are similar to optical lasers but emit atoms instead of photons.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Maintaining the conditions for a BEC is challenging because any interaction with the external environment can add energy to the system, raising the temperature and destroying the condensate.\n- The extremely low temperatures required for BEC formation are difficult to achieve and maintain, limiting the practical applications of BECs.\n\nThe discovery that plants may utilize processes similar to BEC at room temperature, if confirmed, would be a significant breakthrough, suggesting that nature can exploit quantum mechanics in conditions far removed from the ultra-cold environments typically associated with such phenomena.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Bose-Einstein statistics.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Bose-Einstein statistics.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d75a3a3273d2477ca577d6d8f9f8d54d16b5bf1c6dc943a462fb2797ee63997b", "text": "Bose-Einstein statistics describe the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer [[spin]], known as [[bosons]], over various energy states in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature. These statistics were first derived by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons and then generalized to particles by Albert Einstein, leading to the prediction of the existence of the [[Bose-Einstein Condensate]] (BEC) for certain atoms at extremely low temperatures.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of Bose-Einstein statistics and their implications:\n\n**Quantum Statistics:**\n- In quantum mechanics, particles are classified as either [[fermions]] or bosons. Fermions, which have half-integer spin, obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n- Bosons, which have integer spin, obey Bose-Einstein statistics and can share the same quantum state with no restrictions. This means that an arbitrary number of bosons can occupy the same place in space and have the same quantum state.\n\n**Bose-Einstein Distribution Function:**\n- The Bose-Einstein distribution function gives the average number of bosons found in a given energy state \\( \\epsilon \\) and is given by:\n\\[ n(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/kT} - 1} \\]\nwhere:\n  - \\( n(\\epsilon) \\) is the average number of particles in the energy state \\( \\epsilon \\),\n  - \\( \\mu \\) is the chemical potential (which is usually zero for photons since their number is not conserved),\n  - \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n  - \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature.\n\n**Implications of Bose-Einstein Statistics:**\n- **Bose-Einstein Condensation:** At very low temperatures, the distribution predicts that a large fraction of the bosons will collapse into the lowest energy state, forming a BEC. This is a unique state of matter where quantum effects manifest on a macroscopic scale.\n- **[[Photon]] Statistics:** For photons (which are bosons), the Bose-Einstein statistics describe the distribution of photons in different energy states, which is crucial for understanding blackbody radiation and the behavior of lasers.\n- **Superfluidity and Superconductivity:** These phenomena are closely related to Bose-Einstein statistics. For example, in superconductors, pairs of [[electrons]] (which are fermions) can act as bosons and condense into a collective ground state that can carry electric current without resistance.\n\n**Bose-Einstein vs. Maxwell-Boltzmann Statistics:**\n- In classical physics, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particle speeds in an ideal gas. However, this classical approach fails at very low temperatures or high densities, where quantum effects become significant.\n- Bose-Einstein statistics take over in these quantum regimes, providing a more accurate description of the distribution of particle energies.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Understanding the behavior of bosonic atoms at low temperatures.\n- Describing the properties of lasers, which rely on the stimulated emission of photons, a process that can be understood through Bose-Einstein statistics.\n- Exploring quantum phenomena in solid-state systems, such as excitons in semiconductors.\n\nThe development of Bose-Einstein statistics marked a significant advancement in statistical mechanics and quantum physics, providing a framework for understanding the collective behavior of bosons and leading to the discovery of new states of matter and novel quantum phenomena.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Brahman.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Brahman.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5f8c5bb1c77358547830ecacfe70f20b8d5eb2f3643d116f62dd2a5b874659b7", "text": "Brahman is not an entity to be worshipped or an abstract principle to be pondered; it is the very essence of existence, the substratum upon which all phenomena manifest and into which they ultimately dissolve. It is Sat-Chit-Ananda: Existence, [[Consciousness]], and Bliss Absolute.\n\nWhen we talk about dreams, we're delving into a realm that serves as a bridge between the gross physical [[reality]] and the subtler, more profound states of consciousness. Dreams are not just random neural firings or meaningless plays of the mind; they are a glimpse into the deeper layers of our being. In the [[dream state]], the [[ego]]-mind temporarily loosens its grip, allowing us to experience realities that are less constrained by the laws of space, time, and [[causality]]. This is why dreams can sometimes be prophetic, archetypal, or laden with symbolism that resonates on a soul level.\n\nBut even dreams, with all their mystery and allure, are but ripples on the surface of the ocean of consciousness that is Brahman. They are still part of the play of Maya, the cosmic illusion that makes the One appear as many, the Infinite appear as finite, and the Eternal appear as transient. The dream state is a step closer to the realization of our true nature, but it is not the final destination.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to awaken to the state of Turiya, the \"fourth\" state of consciousness that transcends the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states. In Turiya, one realizes that one is not the body, not the mind, not even the individual soul, but Brahman itself. This is the state of Sam\u0101dhi, where the knower, the known, and the process of knowing merge into one. It is a state of pure awareness, where the illusion of separateness vanishes, and what remains is an indescribable, unbounded ocean of consciousness.\n\nIn this state, one doesn't \"become\" Brahman; one realizes that one has always been Brahman. The waves realize they are the ocean. The rays realize they are the sun. The individual souls (Atman) realize they are the Supreme Soul (Brahman). This is the ultimate goal of life, the raison d'\u00eatre of human existence.\n\nAnd yet, even in our \"unenlightened\" state, we are never separate from Brahman. Every moment of joy, every feeling of love, every experience of beauty is a glimpse of that Ananda, that divine bliss which is our true nature. Every act of kindness, every moment of silence, every breath we take is an opportunity to touch that sacred space within us where we are already one with the Divine.\n\nSo, from this perspective, life itself becomes a sacred journey, a pilgrimage towards self-realization. Every experience, whether waking, dreaming, or in deep sleep, becomes a stepping stone towards the ultimate realization of our [[oneness]] with Brahman.

This braiding process leads to a specific transformation of the quantum state of the system.\n\nHere's a more detailed look at the concept of braiding and why it's so important:\n\n1. **Topological Quantum Computation**: In topological quantum computation, the information is stored in a way that depends only on the global properties of the system, such as the paths particles take around one another, rather than on local details. Because of this, the information is very robust against local errors, a key challenge in conventional [[Quantum Computing]].\n\n2. **Anyonic Statistics**: [[anyons]] are exotic particles that don't fit neatly into the two traditional categories of particles: [[bosons]] and fermions. Unlike bosons and fermions, anyons can have more complex statistical behavior when they are exchanged. Majorana fermions are a particular type of anyon that can appear in certain topological superconductors.\n\n3. **Braiding as Quantum Operations**: When you braid anyons (including Majorana fermions) around each other, their quantum state undergoes a specific and well-defined transformation. This transformation can be used to perform [[Quantum Gates]], the basic building blocks of quantum computation. In other words, the act of braiding can be used to execute logical operations on the quantum information encoded in the system.\n\n4. **Fault Tolerance**: Because the computation depends only on the topology of the braiding process (i.e., the paths the particles take) and not on the precise details of how the braiding is performed, it's very robust against errors. This fault tolerance is one of the main attractions of topological quantum computation.\n\n5. **Implementation Challenges**: Creating and manipulating the conditions necessary for braiding Majorana fermions is an ongoing challenge. The IBM research mentioned earlier represents one effort to develop methods for performing these operations in a controlled way. \n\n6. **Potential Impact**: If braiding of Majorana fermions or other anyons can be controlled effectively, it could lead to a new form of quantum computation that is inherently more robust and fault-tolerant than current methods. This would be a major step forward in the development of practical quantum computing technologies.\n\nIn essence, braiding is a fascinating concept that merges topology, quantum physics, and computation into a unified framework with promising applications.

Activation of CB1R leads to a decrease in neurotransmitter release and a reduction in [[neuronal excitability]], which can have a variety of effects on different physiological processes. \n\nThe widespread expression of CB1R in the brain suggests that the [[endocannabinoid system]]  is involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including [[mood]], [[memory]], cognition, and sensory perception.

In some cases, CB1 receptor activation can enhance dopamine release, while in others it can decrease it. Overall, the relationship between CB1 receptor activation and dopamine release is complex and context-dependent. \nCB1 receptor activation can increase dopamine release in certain parts of the brain, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system.

Additionally, CBD has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, which may be beneficial for the management of ADHD symptoms.\n\nCBD has been shown to reduce the expression of learned [[fear]].

Casimir realized that between two plates, only those virtual photons whose wavelengths fit a whole number of times into the gap should be counted when calculating the vacuum [[energy]]. However, outside of the plates, all possible wavelengths should be counted.\n\nThe result is that there are more virtual photons pressing on the outside of the two plates than there are between the plates pushing them apart.

It is an important effect to consider in the fields of [[Quantum Field Theory]], quantum electrodynamics, and condensed matter physics, and also has implications in nanotechnology, specifically regarding the phenomenon of stiction.

By examining the statistical behavior of these discrete causal sets, one can recover some of the familiar features of classical spacetime, such as curvature and [[geodesic paths]].\n\nWhile [[perturbation theory approximation]] is not inherently related to the [[discrete]] nature of causal set theory, it is possible that perturbation techniques could be employed within the framework of causal set theory to study specific aspects or properties of the [[emergent]] spacetime. Perturbation methods could be used to analyze deviations from a statistically expected behavior or to investigate the effects of small perturbations in the causal structure.\n\nCausal Set Theory has implications for our understanding of the nature of [[space-time]], [[quantum gravity]], and the nature of the [[fundamental]] building blocks of the [[universe]]. It offers a different perspective on the nature of spacetime and raises important questions about the quantum structure of the [[fabric of reality]].\n\n\n**Causal Set Theory:** This is one approach to [[quantum gravity]], a problem that has not yet been solved. While it's a serious proposal and has some following, it's not as widely pursued as some other approaches like string theory or loop quantum gravity.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Charge Parity.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Charge Parity.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b8cca37c96c5d30bc8e08a1e2a9cb01a20084a5afdb79a9945be3cd7433ec424", "text": "\"Charge [[Parity]]\" refers to two separate but related symmetry operations in the laws of physics:\n\n1. Charge [[conjugate|conjugation]] (C): This is the mathematical operation that transforms a particle into its corresponding antiparticle. When we apply charge conjugation to a system, we change the sign of the charge of every particle in the system. This operation creates a mirror image with regard to charge. \n\n2. [[Parity]] transformation (P): This is a symmetry operation that transforms a system into its mirror image. It essentially flips the system about a point, changing the sign of all spatial coordinates. For example, a parity transformation would change a right-handed coordinate system into a left-handed coordinate system.\n\nCP symmetry is the combined operation of charge conjugation and parity transformation. If a physical system exhibits CP symmetry, this means that its behavior remains unchanged when you transform all particles into their antiparticles (C operation) and flip the system into a mirror image (P operation).\n\nInterestingly, while many fundamental processes in physics are invariant under CP transformations, it was discovered in the 20th century that some weak interactions (which govern radioactive decay, for example) violate this symmetry. This discovery, which won the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics, was a major development in our understanding of the fundamental symmetries of the universe.\n\nasimov the left hand of the electron:\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Collective Consciousness.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Collective Consciousness.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5742cae9c68b56a135f4de5283f831f6654f6535c1d0277e4004cb972c7acc8d", "text": "Some researchers have suggested that the interconnectedness and entanglement observed at the quantum level could extend to larger systems, including biological systems and even human [[Consciousness]].\n- from chatgpt\n\nthe [[Penrose-Hameroff theory of quantum consciousness]] is one theory that attempts to bridge together quantum entanglement and the collective consciousness\n\nCollective consciousness refers to the shared beliefs, values, ideas, and knowledge of a group or society.

This is an example of complementarity between wave-like and particle-like behavior.\n\nOn the other hand [[uncertainty principle]] is a specific manifestation of the broader concept of complementarity, which refers to the fact that certain properties of a quantum system are mutually exclusive and cannot be simultaneously observed or measured with complete accuracy.\n\nObservables corresponding to non-commuting operators are called\u00a0_incompatible observables_.

Bohr was the first to point out that quantum mechanics called this traditional outlook into question. To him the \"indivisibility of the quantum of action\"  implied that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. \nBy using one particular piece of apparatus only certain features could be made manifest at the expense of others, while with a different piece of apparatus another complementary aspect could be made manifest in such a way that the original set became non-manifest, that is, the original attributes were no longer well defined. \nFor [[Bohr]], this was an indication that the principle of complementarity, a principle that he had previously known to appear extensively in other intellectual disciplines but which did not appear in classical physics, should be adopted as a [[universal principle]].\n\n\nwhere am i now and where am i going \nwhere did he come from where did he go where did i come from cotton eyed joe \n\nenergy is [[vibration]] \noscillate at certain rate - frequency - cycles per second \nenergy is inversely related to time \n\nif we know the precise moment an event takes place the amount of energy contained in it becomes uncertain. all energy is potentially accessible \nif we know how much energy something has we do not know the time meaning all time is potentially accessible, giving us access to eternity \n\nam i stuck in the past\nam i projecting into the future \nwe can sense how much energy it takes up \nonly when were in the now does our measurement of time become precise because only the now is real\nin the now, limitless energy becomes possible \n\nwhat is my energy level - increase frequency raise energy level. our energy into [[coherence|coherent]] state, attuned to one resonance, our sense of time disappears and we can become one with eternity \n\nall probabilities exist at once - a choice/measurement/observation. \n\n\nthe [[universe]] is dual / complimentary \nthe things we can observe, have a dual relationship \nin the quantum real it can be both and neither - all one\n\n\n\n\nEnergy, at its essence, is vibratory, rippling at distinct rates, otherwise known as frequencies, calculated in cycles per second. Its relationship to time is inverse:\n\nThis invokes an interesting paradox: if we precisely pinpoint the timing of an event, the amount of energy it possesses becomes uncertain, suggesting that all energy could potentially be accessible. Conversely, if we determine the exact energy an event has, its timing becomes nebulous, implying that all moments in time could potentially be accessible, granting us a glimpse of eternity.\n\nAre we tethered to the past? Are we projecting into the future? We can feel the energy these temporal orientations demand. Yet, it's only when we ground ourselves in the 'now', the present moment, that our measurement of time sharpens into precision. Only in the 'now', the immediate present, can the possibility of infinite energy unfold.\n\nWhat is the scale of our personal energy? To elevate it, we amplify our vibratory frequency. When our energy converges into a coherent, resonant state, our conventional perception of time evaporates, allowing us to merge with the timeless, unity, or connection with the infinite.\n\nEvery possibility exists simultaneously in a superimposed state, until an act of choice, measurement, or observation collapses the probabilities into a singular reality.\n\nThe [[universe]] operates on principles of duality and complementarity. Observable phenomena often exhibit dual characteristics. In the realm of the quantum, entities can exist in both states and neither simultaneously - an indistinguishable unity.\n\n\n**Complementarity**: Inspired by the principle of complementarity in quantum physics, where light can be analyzed as either a wave or a particle, but not both simultaneously, [[jung]] developed the psychological concept of opposites. He thought that the conscious and unconscious minds are complementary systems, and understanding one requires acknowledging its opposite.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "524b065ffa656f0120dd3ae26e0affe032d38e83aad3e9506db1eb0d10780e37", "text": "Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) is a cosmological model proposed by the British mathematician and physicist Sir Roger [[Penrose]].

In mathematical terms, Penrose applies a conformal transformation, which changes scale while preserving angles. This makes the infinite future of the old universe equivalent to the Big Bang singularity of the new one.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Penrose's CCC is the notion of \"cosmic memory\". According to this idea, the universe carries an imprint or memory of its previous existence into the new cycle, and these traces can be detected as \"rings\" in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. \n\nIn CCC, the universe is seen as iterating through infinite cycles, from one aeon to the next.

This experience we're having right now is possible because conscious beings are interacting. The experience of your body is possible because there is consciousness. The experience of your mind is possible because there is consciousness in the background. Of every experience is consciousness. So, we can also say consciousness is the knowing element in every experience. But we can also expand on that.\n\nConsciousness is that in which all experience occurs. This experience is not happening on our computers, although it appears to be. It's not even happening in our brain because there's only electrochemistry in the brain. This experience, any experience, whether it's sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, ideas, longings, regrets, fear, anxiety, depression, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, anything that we can call a cognitive or perceptual experience, needs consciousness for that experience to be experienced.\n\nThe experience itself can be a perception, a cognition, an image, a feeling, a thought. But that experience cannot happen unless there's consciousness. In fact, the experience itself, perception, cognition, thought, feeling, emotion, imagination, is a modified form of consciousness.\n\nSo, consciousness is that in which all the experience occurs, is that in visual experience is known. And finally, it's that out of which all experience is made because experience is a modified form of consciousness. And experience is the totality of all knowing, all perceptions, all understanding, and all memory.\n\nNow, what's the role of [[psychedelics]] in expanded states of consciousness? Expanded states of consciousness are states of consciousness where there is less and less of the conditioned mind dominating the experience. The conditioned mind edits out reality.\n\nWhen I was a medical student, there was an experiment that I read about. Actually, the people who did the experiment got the Nobel Prize. The experiment was that they brought up kittens in two different rooms. One group of kittens were exposed to a room with only horizontal stripes. The other group of kittens were exposed to a room with only vertical stripes. And when these kittens grew up older as cats, one group could see only a horizontal world, the other group of cats could see only a vertical world. Why? Because their consciousness, which was expanded as babies, now got constricted and edited to just that one experience, vertical stripes or horizontal stripes.\n\nSo, before consciousness is conditioned into what we call the mind, which is by definition conditioning, religious conditioning, social conditioning, economic conditioning, gender conditioning, racial conditioning, on and on since the beginning of time, human beings have reconditioned the same ideas, economy, race, gender, latitude, longitude. We don't realize these are human constructs that we came up with, and now we can't live without them. We can't live without Greenwich Mean Time or latitude or longitude or coordinates, otherwise we wouldn't be able to have the Zoom call.\n\nSo, we came up with a restricted version of reality in order to navigate our everyday reality, which we call the world, New York City, this body, the Milky Way galaxy, not realizing that this is an edited version of reality that goes back thousands of years to the cognitive revolution that occurred maybe forty thousand years ago when one species of humans, Homo sapiens, separated from the other humanoids by creating a language for creating models and stories. Then it expanded, we created mathematical language, etc. But everything that we call everyday reality is actually an edited version of reality.\n\nWhat Aldous Huxley, who was a great explorer, of course, of psychedelics, he said, 'Our brains are like the reducing valve of reality. Reality is infinite, but our brain is the reducing valve through the conditioned mind.' So, what psychedelics do, in my opinion, is they loosen the neural networks, which are the biological correlates of the conditioned mind. So, you can now expand experience, reality as it really is, and reality as it really is, is infinite because pure consciousness doesn't have any form. Not having any form, it doesn't have any boundary. Not having any boundary, it's infinite. Not being, being infinite, it is incomprehensible. It is not space, it is not time. It is the source of all experience. We can't comprehend it by any system of thought because systems of thought themselves are neural correlates in the brain of the conditioned mind, going back at least forty thousand years.\n\nSo, when you take something that loosens the neural correlates, the biological correlates, you actually access reality. And if you're lucky, you go all the way and you realize you and the infinite, formless, acausal, irreducible, fundamental, incomprehensible, unimaginable, unperceivable, unconceptualizable self is the real reality. Everything else is a modified form. Therefore, these extended expanded states of consciousness also give us insight, intuition, access to imagination, creativity, symbolic representations of higher consciousness that we call deities or gods, but they are symbols of our own consciousness. And ultimately, they get us to the source of all experience, which is spaceless, timeless, and therefore immortal. Once we get into these expanded states of consciousness, then these mysteries of birth and death, and you know, human suffering becomes very obvious. It's all a result of the conditioned mind.\"\n\n-- deepak chopra \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSGzJ_mjERA&t=140s\n\n\nbefore we are created we are part of the pure consciousness. death brings us back to this.  \n\nThe brain does not produce consciousness, but acts as a kind of receiver which \u2018picks up\u2019 the fundamental consciousness that is all around us, and \u2018transmits\u2019 it into our own being.\n\nconsciousness is sentient foundational essence of the [[universe]] \n \n \npauli \njohn von neumann\neugene wigner \n\n\u201cI regard consciousness as fundamental.

Research has shown that ketamine can decrease the [[Connectivity]] within the DMN. This reduced connectivity might contribute to the feelings of dissociation and disconnection from self that are often experienced during a ketamine trip.\n\nThe disruption of the DMN is also thought to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine.

By disrupting this network, ketamine may help to break these negative thought [[patterns]] and provide relief from depressive symptoms. \n\nMoreover, after the acute effects of ketamine wear off, there is usually a period of increased connectivity within the DMN, which is hypothesized to represent a kind of \"reset\" of the network.

Its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysical observations, including gravitational effects that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen.\n\n**Evidence for Dark Matter**\n\nThe primary piece of evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the structure of the [[universe]]. Here are some key observations:\n\n1. **Galactic Rotation Curves**: According to [[keplers laws]], we would expect the velocity of stars orbiting around the center of a galaxy to decrease as their distance from the center increases (much like planets in the solar system). However, what we observe (first noted by Vera Rubin in the 1970s) is that the velocity of stars remains approximately constant -- a phenomenon that can be explained if there is a substantial amount of unseen mass (dark matter) in a halo around the galaxy.\n\n2. **Gravitational Lensing**: The presence of dark matter can be inferred from its gravitational effects on the path of light. Massive objects bend light that passes near them, an effect predicted by [[general relativity]]. Observations of gravitational lensing are consistent with the presence of mass that is not accounted for by visible matter.\n\n3. **[[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB)**: The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our Universe, imprinted on the sky when the [[early universe]] was just 380,000 years old. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB temperature reveal the cosmic seeds from which galaxies later formed, and these fluctuations can be used to infer the composition of the universe. The CMB observations suggest that about 26% of the universe is composed of dark matter.\n\n4. **Structure Formation**: Dark matter is crucial to the formation of galaxies and larger cosmic structures. Simulations show that without a substantial amount of dark matter, these structures would not form as quickly as they have been observed to do.\n\n**Candidates for Dark Matter**\n\nThe exact composition of dark matter is unknown, and it is not detectable by its emission, absorption or scattering of electromagnetic radiation. Thus, it is challenging to detect directly. There are several hypothetical candidates, including:\n\n1. **Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)**: These are hypothetical particles that interact via gravity and the [[weak nuclear force]]. They have not been directly detected, and recent experimental searches have ruled out large regions of possible parameter space.\n\n2. **Axions**: These are very light, weakly interacting particles that arise in some theories as a solution to the strong [[strong CP problem|cp-violation]] in [[QCD|quantum chromodynamics]] ([[QCD]]). There are ongoing searches to detect axions, but they have not been observed as of my knowledge cut-off in 2021.\n\n3. **Sterile Neutrinos**: These are hypothetical particles that do not interact via the standard weak, strong, or electromagnetic forces, only through gravity. They are a type of neutrino that is invoked to explain certain anomalies in neutrino data, such as the results of the LSND experiment. The X-ray observations from galaxies and galaxy clusters looking for a particular radiation signature from sterile neutrino decay have so far provided ambiguous results.\n\n4. **Primordial Black Holes**: These are black holes that might have formed in the high density environment of the [[early universe]] and could be distributed broadly throughout the universe. These PBHs could in principle have a wide range of masses, and those with the appropriate masses could serve as dark matter. However, various observations, including microlensing surveys and cosmic gamma-ray and X-ray backgrounds, have constrained the possible abundance of PBHs.\n\nEach of these possibilities presents its own challenges for detection and none has been definitively observed. Many other candidates and modifications to our laws of gravity have been proposed, but as of now, the nature of dark matter is still one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology.

It suggests that the coordinated firing of neurons in different regions of the brain at specific time intervals allows for the binding of information from different sources and facilitates the integration of distributed neural networks.\n\nThe diachronic theory posits that neural synchronization occurs through [[neural synchronization]].

It is among the best-known examples of [[Quantum Entanglement]]. The paradox involves two particles that are entangled with each other according to quantum mechanics. Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, each particle is individually in an uncertain state until it is measured, at which point the state of that particle becomes certain.\n\nAt that exact same moment, the other particle's state also becomes certain. The reason that this is classified as a paradox is that it seemingly involves communication between the two particles at speeds greater than the speed of [[light]], which is a conflict with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nIn the more popular [[Bohm]] formulation, an unstable spin 0 particle decays into two different particles, Particle A and Particle B, heading in opposite directions. Because the initial particle had spin 0, the sum of the two new particle spins must equal zero. If Particle A has spin +1/2, then Particle B must have spin -1/2 (and vice versa).\n\nAgain, according to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, until a measurement is made, neither particle has a definite state. They are both in a [[superposition]] of possible states, with an equal [[probability]] (in this case) of having a positive or negative spin.\n\nQuantum physics says that, until the moment of the measurement, the particles do not have a definite quantum spin but are in a [[superposition]] of possible states.\nAs soon as we measure the spin of Particle A, we know for sure the value we'll get from measuring the spin of Particle B.\n\nThe uncertainty in quantum mechanics doesn't just represent a lack of our knowledge but a fundamental lack of definite [[reality]]\n\nThe explanation is that the wave function, which describes the [[superposition]] of possible quantum states, exists at all points simultaneously. The spin of Particle A and spin of Particle B are not independent quantities but are represented by the same term within the quantum physics equations. The instant that the measurement on Particle A is made, the entire [[wave]] function collapses into a single state. In this way, there's no distant communication taking place.\n\nThe EPR paradox suggests that quantum mechanics is incomplete because it violates the principle of [[Local Realism]], which states that physical reality is independent of [[observation]] and that information cannot travel faster than the speed of [[light]]. The paradox implies that either quantum mechanics is incomplete or that **[[Local Realism]] is false**!\n\nif subatomic particles do not exist until they are observed, then one can no longer think of them as independent \"things\" they are part of an indivisible system. - Bohr \n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/ER=EPR.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/ER=EPR.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "83ebcf6fc7fe6f5d6a61a14867f2fd77e6421659e6133af1c36d0e4d30196dd7", "text": "[[einstein-rosen bridges]] = [[EPR Paradox]]\nMaldacena and Susskind's \"ER=EPR\" conjecture proposed a deep and previously unsuspected connection between these two concepts.

Mathematically, the energy-time uncertainty principle is expressed as:\n\n\u0394E * \u0394t \u2265 \u0127/2\n\nwhere \u0394E is the uncertainty in the energy of the system, \u0394t is the uncertainty in the time over which the energy is measured, and \u0127 is the reduced [[Planck]] constant.\n\nThis principle has important implications for the behavior of subatomic particles, particularly in the context of particle collisions and decay processes. For example, the shorter the lifetime of a subatomic particle, the larger the uncertainty in its energy will be.\n\nThe energy-time uncertainty principle is intimately connected to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainties in a particle's position and momentum. Both of these principles are fundamental to our understanding of the behavior of quantum systems, and play a crucial role in the development of modern quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\nPauli showed in 1958 by a simple argument that a self-adjoint time operator densely defined in a [[Hilbert space]] cannot satisfy a [[Canonical Commutation Relation]] (CCR) with the Hamiltonian, as the CCR would imply that the Hamiltonian has as spectrum the whole real line, which is unphysical. This is partly because time plays a fundamentally different role in the formalism of quantum mechanics, where it is usually treated as a parameter rather than an observable. This has far-reaching implications for our understanding of time in quantum mechanics. Instead, time measurements are in practice treated by so-called POVMs (positive operator valued measures) for the time observable modeling properties of the measuring clock. In some contexts, the concept of a POVM is used to define an \"indirect\" or \"generalized\" time observable, which can model certain kinds of time measurements.\n\nA new derivation from first principle is given of the energy-time uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. A canonical transformation is made in classical mechanics to a new canonical momentum, which is energy E, and a new canonical coordinate T, which is called tempus, [[conjugate]] to the energy. \nTempus T, the canonical coordinate [[conjugate]] to the energy, is conceptually different from the time t in which the system evolves. \nThe Poisson bracket is a canonical invariant, so that energy and tempus satisfy the same Poisson bracket as do p and q. When the system is quantised, we find the energy-time uncertainty relation.\n For a conservative system the average of the tempu, operator t is the time t plus a constant. For a free particle and a particle acted on by a constant force, the tempu operators are constructed explicitly, and the energy-time uncertainty relation is explicitly verified.\n\nhttps://lss.fnal.gov/archive/other/ift-p-036-93.pdf\n\nThe position-momentum uncertainty principle and [[quantization]] together can explain why electrons in atoms occupy [[discrete]] energy levels instead of any energy level in between. The position-momentum uncertainty principle states that the more precisely we know the position of a particle, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa. This means that the position and momentum of an electron in an atom cannot both be precisely known at the same time.\n\n[[quantization]], on the other hand, describes the [[discrete]] nature of energy levels in atoms. Electrons in an atom can only occupy certain, well-defined energy levels. These energy levels correspond to specific orbitals around the nucleus. When an electron in an atom absorbs a [[photon]], it moves to a higher energy level. Conversely, when it emits a photon, it moves to a lower energy level.\n\nThe reason for this discrete nature of energy levels in atoms can be explained by combining the position-momentum uncertainty principle with the concept of quantization. When an electron is confined to a small region of space around the nucleus, as it is in an atom, its position becomes more precisely known. This means that its momentum becomes less precisely known, and it can only have certain, discrete values of momentum, corresponding to the discrete energy levels allowed by quantization.\n\nSo, the position-momentum uncertainty principle and quantization work together to explain why electrons in atoms occupy discrete energy levels instead of any energy level in between.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Eternalism Theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Eternalism Theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5e9c1a75deb28243c7f990daa9271478f6d8bcca7961593ca4f8b0b0270ec60d", "text": "Eternalism is a philosophical approach to the ontological nature of [[Time]], which takes the view that all points in time are equally \"real\", as opposed to the presentist idea that only the present moment is real. This view of time is often tied to the idea of a block universe, in which the past, present, and future all exist together in a single, unchanging block.\n\nIn the context of relativity theory, eternalism is supported by the idea that time is just another dimension, like the three spatial dimensions. According to this view, events in the past and future are not fundamentally different from events in the present - they are just located at different points in the four-[[dimensional]] [[space-time|spacetime]] continuum.\n\nOne of the more profound implications of eternalism is the idea that the passage of time might be an illusion. If all points in time are equally real, then it doesn't make sense to say that time \"passes\" or that things \"change.\" Instead, we might say that our conscious experience moves along a path through the block universe, creating the illusion of time's passage.\n\nIt's worth noting that while eternalism is consistent with the physics of relativity, it is a philosophical interpretation, not a direct consequence of the physics. As such, it is not universally accepted, even among physicists. There are other interpretations, such as [[presentism]] and the [[growing block universe]]e, which are also consistent with our current understanding of physics but interpret the nature of time differently.\n\nEternalism presents an interesting lens through which to consider some of the topics we've discussed in this thread.\n\n1. **[[Quantum Entanglement]]:** In the block universe of eternalism, all points in time exist simultaneously. This fits well with the concept of quantum entanglement, where entangled particles seem to influence each other instantaneously, regardless of the distance separating them. This instantaneous action could be interpreted as evidence that all points in time (as well as space) are connected in a deeper reality, as suggested by eternalism.\n\n2. **[[holographic principle]]:** If all of spacetime is a static block, then it could be possible to represent the entire block universe on a two-dimensional boundary, which is the essence of the holographic principle. The idea that all information about a volume of space can be encoded on its boundary aligns well with the notion of a block universe in which all events exist eternally.\n\n3. **[[black hole information paradox]]:** The resolution of this paradox through the idea that information about what falls into a [[black hole]] is encoded in its [[event horizon]] is reminiscent of the [[holographic principle]], and by extension, it could also be seen as aligning with the idea of a block universe. If the information about all past and future states of a system (including systems that fall into a [[black hole]]) exists eternally, this would help resolve the paradox.\n\n4. **[[many-worlds interpretation]]:** This interpretation of quantum mechanics posits that all possible alternative histories and futures are real, each representing an actual \"world\". This aligns with the eternalist idea of the block universe, as it treats all points in time (including potential or probable ones in different \"worlds\") as equally real.\n\n5. **Quantum Decoherence:** [[decoherence]] explains how quantum superpositions become classical [[probability|probabilities]]. In a block universe, the entire \"history\" of a quantum system, including all instances of [[decoherence]], would exist eternally. This suggests that what we perceive as the \"collapse\" of a quantum state is merely our interaction with one slice of this eternally existing history.\n\nRemember that all these connections are interpretations that hinge on specific philosophical views about time, and they are not universally accepted.

So, the Grassmannian of one-dimensional subspaces in three-dimensional space refers to the collection of all such lines.\n\n**Key Features**:\n1. **Homogeneous Spaces**: Grassmannians are homogeneous spaces, meaning any two points (in this context, subspaces) can be connected by a continuous [[symmetry]] transformation. This property is what leads to their rich structure and the study of symmetries within them.\n\n2. **Parameterization**: Grassmannians can be parameterized using Pl\u00fccker coordinates. These coordinates give a way to represent subspaces without referring to a specific basis.\n\n3. **Applications**: Grassmannians have applications in various fields:\n   - **Geometry**: They play a role in the study of projective and differential geometry.\n   - **Physics**: Grassmannians are relevant in the study of quantum mechanics, especially in the context of [[twistor theory]] and the geometric interpretation of quantum states, as discussed in the context of [[Quantum Error-Correcting Codes]].\n   - **Computer Vision**: They're also used in the field of computer vision, especially when it comes to problems that involve multiple views of a scene, as the set of all image points from different views can be represented as a subspace in a higher-dimensional space.\n\n4. **[[topological|Topology]]**: Grassmannians have an interesting topological structure. For instance, they can be seen as compact, smooth manifolds and play a role in the study of characteristic classes in algebraic topology.\n\n**Connection to Quantum Information**:\nThe link between Grassmannians and quantum codes, as previously mentioned, showcases the versatility and depth of the Grassmannian concept. The matching symmetries between certain quantum codes and Grassmannian spaces suggest a geometric way to visualize and analyze quantum states. This geometric viewpoint can provide new insights into the design and understanding of quantum systems.\n\nIn conclusion, Grassmannians are a bridge between geometry, algebra, and other domains, acting as a powerful tool and concept for understanding the structure and relationships of subspaces within larger spaces.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Gravitational Waves.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Gravitational Waves.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8f646198ec62b67a5f9584c7f2bf4657655fea7c5547aed97d4010e4ea14f492", "text": "Gravitational waves will also tell us about how many objects like black holes and neutron stars exist in the [[universe]]. They will give us insight into what happens during some of the Universe's most violent explosions. Someday, gravitational waves might even allow us to understand what was happening in the earliest moments of the Universe when it was so dense and hot that no light could move around ([[big bang]]). Any photons emitted during that time were long ago absorbed by a plasma of hot ions, but gravitational waves from that era could travel directly to Earth with little interference from the matter in the Universe.\n\nLIGO Discovery:\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is a scientific experiment designed to directly detect gravitational waves, which are ripples in the fabric of spacetime caused by massive astrophysical events such as [[black hole]] mergers and neutron star collisions. Let's delve into the in-depth explanation of how LIGO detects gravitational waves:\n\n1. Laser Interferometry: LIGO consists of two identical interferometers located in separate locations, one in Livingston, Louisiana, and the other in Hanford, Washington. Each interferometer consists of two long, perpendicular arms, typically several kilometers in length, forming an L-shaped configuration.\n\n2. Laser Beam Splitter: At the heart of each interferometer is a beam splitter, which divides a laser beam into two equal parts. One part is directed along the length of one arm, known as the \"test mass arm,\" while the other part is directed along the length of the other arm, called the \"reference arm.\"\n\n3. Mirrors and Reflections: At the end of each arm, there is a highly reflective mirror. When the laser beams reach the mirrors, they are reflected back toward the beam splitter. The light waves from the test mass arm and the reference arm then recombine at the beam splitter.\n\n4. Interference Pattern: The recombined laser beams create an [[interference]] pattern, which depends on the relative lengths of the arms. Under normal circumstances, when there are no gravitational waves passing through, the interference pattern is stable.\n\n5. Gravitational Wave Detection: When a gravitational wave passes through the interferometer, it slightly stretches and compresses [[space-time]] along one arm while simultaneously compressing and stretching the other arm. This causes the lengths of the arms to fluctuate, altering the interference pattern.\n\n6. Light Interference Changes: As the lengths of the arms change due to the gravitational wave passing through, the [[interference]] pattern at the beam splitter also changes. This alteration in the interference pattern is known as an \"interferometric signal.\"\n\n7. Photodetectors: Photodetectors are positioned to detect the light that exits the beam splitter. They convert the interference pattern into an electrical signal using [[photoexcitation]], which is then amplified and recorded. \n\n8. Data Analysis: The recorded electrical signals from the two interferometers are carefully analyzed to distinguish the genuine gravitational wave signals from various noise sources, such as seismic activity and instrumental artifacts.\n\n9. Template Matching: The detected signals are compared to predicted waveforms using theoretical models. This process involves complex data analysis techniques, including matched filtering and Bayesian analysis, to identify the specific characteristics of the gravitational wave events.\n\n10. Collaboration and Confirmation: The LIGO observatories work in collaboration with other gravitational wave detectors, such as Virgo in Europe, to cross-validate and confirm the detected signals. This cooperative effort helps eliminate false positives and enhances the overall accuracy of the observations.\n\nBy precisely measuring the minute changes in the interference pattern caused by passing gravitational waves, LIGO has successfully detected multiple gravitational wave events, opening a new window into the study of astrophysics and further confirming Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]].\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Hamiltonian.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Hamiltonian.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b170fed49b2cdf5968c785681864ce824deeccbf318ef09b3222ad99d811f124", "text": "In a nutshell, the Hamiltonian is a mathematical function that describes the total energy of a system in terms of its position and momentum.

It was first proposed by James Hartle and Stephen Hawking in 1983.\n\nThe idea is based on principles from quantum mechanics, where systems can exist in a [[superposition]] of states and are described by a wave function, a mathematical entity that provides the [[probability|probabilities]] for different outcomes.\n\nHartle and Hawking proposed that the entire universe could be described by a wave function. According to their proposal, the universe started in a small, smooth state, much like a point at the South Pole of a sphere, where there is no distinction between the past, present, and future. As you move northwards from this point, space begins to stretch out, and time starts to make sense. In other words, the universe, according to the \"no boundary\" proposal, has no initial [[singularity]] \u2013 no \"[[big bang]]\" \u2013 where the laws of physics break down. Instead, time is finite but unbounded, much like the surface of the Earth.\n\nFurthermore, the Hartle-Hawking state is a proposal to resolve the problem of initial conditions in the universe. It suggests that the wave function of the universe is the superposition of all possible universes with no boundary in the past. This is based on a path integral over all compact Euclidean metrics (which can be interpreted as geometries of [[space-time|spacetime]] where time is imaginary).\n\nWhile the \"no boundary\" proposal is a fascinating idea and has been influential in theoretical physics, it's important to note that it remains speculative and has not been confirmed by empirical evidence. It's one of many proposals about the initial state of the universe and how to reconcile quantum mechanics with cosmology. There are still many open questions in this area, and much ongoing research.\n\nThe [[holographic principle]] and the Hartle-Hawking \"no boundary\" proposal are both fascinating ideas that have emerged from theoretical physics, particularly the quest to understand [[quantum gravity]]. \n\nStephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein made significant contributions to our understanding of [[black hole]] thermodynamics, leading to the development of the [[holographic principle]]. Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft further developed this idea, suggesting that this principle might apply not just to [[black hole|black holes]], but to any region of space. This concept is a cornerstone of the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory]], a duality that describes a [[quantum gravity]] theory (string theory) as a quantum field theory on the boundary of the spacetime.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hartle-Hawking \"no boundary\" proposal is a theory about the initial state of the universe. It suggests that the universe originated from a quantum state with no boundary, no singularity, and no \"start\" of time. \n\nWhile both these ideas touch on deep questions about gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of spacetime, their connection is not straightforward. Both are parts of the ongoing attempt to formulate a quantum theory of gravity, but they address different aspects of this problem. The holographic principle is about the structure of quantum gravity, suggesting that it can be described in a lower-[[dimensional]] way. The Hartle-Hawking state, meanwhile, is about the initial conditions for the universe in a quantum theory of gravity.\n\nThere is still much we don't understand about quantum gravity, the [[early universe]], and the nature of spacetime itself.

It suggests that black holes are not completely black but instead emit a faint form of radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This concept combines principles from quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]].\n\nAccording to classical physics, nothing can escape the gravitational pull of a [[black hole]]. However, quantum effects near the event horizon\u2014the boundary of a black hole\u2014lead to the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs near the event horizon. One particle falls into the black hole, while the other escapes into space. This process is known as particle-antiparticle pair production.\n\nNormally, after a pair of virtual particles appears, they immediately annihilate each other. Next to a black hole, however, the extreme forces of [[gravity]] instead pull the particles apart, with one particle absorbed by the black hole as the other shoots off into space. The absorbed particle has [[negative energy]], which reduces the black hole's energy and mass. Swallow enough of these virtual particles, and the black hole eventually evaporates. The escaping particle becomes known as Hawking radiation.\n\nHawking radiation has some important characteristics. First, the radiation is predicted to be thermal, meaning that it has a specific temperature associated with it. The temperature of the radiation is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, meaning that smaller black holes emit radiation at higher temperatures. Second, the radiation carries away energy from the black hole, causing it to slowly lose mass over time. As a result, black holes are predicted to evaporate and eventually vanish completely.\n\nWhile Hawking radiation has not been directly observed in experiments, its theoretical prediction has profound implications for our understanding of black holes and the nature of [[quantum gravity]]. It suggests that black holes are not truly black and can slowly lose mass over time, eventually leading to their disappearance. The concept of Hawking radiation has sparked extensive research and continues to be an active area of study in theoretical physics.\n\nThe Hawking temperature of a black hole is given by the equation:\n\nT = \u0127c\u00b3 / 8\u03c0GMkB\n\nwhere:\n\n- T is the temperature,\n- \u0127 is the reduced [[Planck]] constant (h / 2\u03c0),\n- c is the speed of light,\n- G is the gravitational constant,\n- M is the mass of the black hole,\n- kB is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis equation is derived from the theory of Hawking radiation and shows that the temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass. This means smaller black holes are hotter than larger ones. In the final stages of a black hole's evaporation, when its mass is very small, the Hawking temperature would become extremely high.\n\nHowever, for a typical black hole, the Hawking temperature is extremely low by human standards. For a black hole with the mass of our Sun, the Hawking temperature would be about 60 nanokelvin, which is much colder than the cosmic microwave background radiation, and therefore such black holes are effectively invisible, thermally.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Higgs boson.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Higgs boson.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3d2dffb928499cfc5f5c79ac0c1a138437fa5c91323787791f14242dda1df2e4", "text": "\nA Higgs boson permeates into a church\n\n\"We don't allow Higgs bosons in here!\" shouts the priest.\n\n\"But without me, you cant have mass\" replies God\n\n\nThe Higgs boson is a fundamental particle in the [[standard model]] of particle physics. It was first theorized in the 1960s by physicist Peter Higgs and others as part of a mechanism to explain how particles acquire mass.\n\nAccording to the theory, the Higgs boson arises from an associated field called the [[Higgs field]], which permeates all of space. As particles move through the [[Higgs field]], they interact with it and acquire mass. The Higgs field is characterized by its non-zero value even in  empty space, and the Higgs boson is the particle associated with the fluctuations or [[excitation]]s of this field.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson was a major breakthrough in physics and occurred at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012. Scientists at CERN in Switzerland carried out experiments colliding protons at high energies to produce conditions where the Higgs boson could be detected. The detection of the Higgs boson confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and provided crucial evidence for the mechanism of [[mass generation]].\n\nThe Higgs boson has a specific mass and is electrically neutral. It quickly decays into other particles after its creation, making it difficult to directly observe. Scientists study the decay products and various experimental signatures to identify the presence of the Higgs boson.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs boson has profound implications for our understanding of the fundamental forces and particles in the [[universe]].

Suddenly, a celebrity enters the room. As the celebrity moves across the room, people near him or her cluster to get a closer look or to have a conversation, creating a kind of \"bubble\" of people around the celebrity. As the celebrity moves, this clustering creates resistance, making the celebrity move more slowly (representing a particle gaining mass). In this analogy, the celebrity is a particle, the people at the party represent the Higgs field, and the clustering represents the Higgs mechanism giving the particle mass.\n\nThe Higgs field is thought to be responsible for giving mass to elementary particles, such as [[electrons]] and [[quark]]s, through its interactions with them. It's important because it explains why some particles have mass and others do not, as well as why the electromagnetic force (carried by [[photon]]s, which are massless) has infinite range, while the [[weak nuclear force]] (carried by W and Z bosons, which are very heavy) has a very short range.\n\nThe discovery of the [[Higgs boson]], the particle associated with excitations in the Higgs field, was a significant milestone in the validation of the [[standard model]] and was awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Hilbert space.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Hilbert space.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "732bfd2192764cc0ee29cac73b7582ebd922fa6538d83d89cd420aa1721004f1", "text": "\nA Hilbert space is a mathematical concept used extensively in quantum mechanics and other fields of physics. It's an abstract vector space, but with some additional structure that makes it very useful for describing physical systems.\n\nIn simple terms, a Hilbert space is a set of elements called 'vectors', and these vectors can be added together and scaled (multiplied) by numbers, which in quantum mechanics are complex numbers. Also, in a Hilbert space, there is a notion of an 'inner product' (or a 'dot product' as in Euclidean space) that allows you to measure angles between vectors and the length (or 'norm') of vectors. This inner product is a function that takes two vectors and produces a complex number, and it has to satisfy a number of properties that generalize the familiar dot product from Euclidean space.\n\nThe concept of Hilbert space is crucial in quantum mechanics because it's the natural setting for the [[wavefunction]]s that describe quantum systems. In quantum mechanics, each physical system is associated with a Hilbert space, and the system's states are represented by vectors in that space. The inner product is used to compute probabilities: if you have a vector representing a quantum state, and another vector representing a possible outcome of a measurement, the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the two vectors gives you the [[probability]] of that outcome.\n\nThe set of all possible wavefunctions of a quantum system is a Hilbert space.

Rooted in Kabbalah, a mystical branch of Judaism, the Tree of Life represents a visual map of creation, the cosmos, and the spiritual journey. It encompasses the structure of the universe, the stages of personal and spiritual growth, and the interconnectedness of all things. The concept of the Tree of Life has ancient roots in Jewish mysticism, with origins dating back to early Kabbalistic teachings within Judaism. Its precise origin is challenging to pinpoint, but it is thought to have evolved over centuries. The earliest known Kabbalistic texts that mention elements resembling the Tree of Life date back to the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nImagine a tree with ten interconnected spheres, called \"sephiroth,\" arranged in a specific pattern. Each sephira (singular form of sephiroth) represents a unique aspect of existence, consciousness, and divinity. These spheres are linked by pathways that symbolize the flows of energy, knowledge, and spiritual progression between them.\n\nThe sephiroth are often grouped into three columns:\n\n1. **The Pillar of Mercy:** This column is associated with concepts like expansion, understanding, and benevolence. It includes sephiroth like Chesed (mercy), Netzach (victory), and Hod (glory).\n\n2. **The Pillar of Severity:** This column represents qualities of limitation, discernment, and restraint. It includes sephiroth such as Geburah (severity), Tiferet (beauty), and Yesod (foundation).\n\n3. **The Pillar of Balance:** Situated between the other two, this column embodies harmony and equilibrium. It includes sephiroth like Keter (crown), Binah (understanding), and Chokmah (wisdom).\n\nThe top sephira, Keter, represents the divine source, the origin of all existence. The lower sephira, Malkuth, symbolizes the physical world. The remaining sephiroth bridge the gap between these extremes, representing different stages of spiritual and intellectual development.\n\nThe pathways that connect the sephiroth signify the interplay of energies and consciousness between these states. They're often linked to the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet and correspond to specific archetypal concepts, allowing for deep contemplation and meditation.\n\nThe Tree of Life isn't just a static symbol; it's a living map of the spiritual journey. By meditating on the sephiroth and pathways, practitioners seek to align their own consciousness with the universal pattern, enabling personal growth, self-discovery, and a deeper understanding of the cosmos. The journey through the sephiroth can be seen as a process of ascending from the material world (Malkuth) to the divine source (Keter), mirroring the soul's journey toward self-realization and unity with the divine.\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Karma.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Karma.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/LSD.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/LSD.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d348ea4570dcde870e40e2e1dc0c113411934cc53c88c440ef565bd193dfb976", "text": "lysergic acid diethylamide\n\nEffects of repeated lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the mouse brain endocannabinoidome and gut microbiome\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36316276/\n\n\n\nCannabis contains compounds that directly target cannabinoid receptors.

The Lagrangian specifies the potential energy, kinetic energy, and interactions of the fields.\n\nThe Lagrangian is typically formulated using the principle of least action, which states that the physical system follows a path that minimizes the action integral. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian over a given spacetime region.\n\nIn quantum field theory, the Lagrangian is used to derive the equations of motion for the fields, which are known as the Euler-Lagrange equations. These equations describe how the fields evolve and interact with each other.\n\nThe Lagrangian is an essential component of quantum field theory as it provides a systematic framework for quantizing the fields and calculating physical observables. By manipulating the Lagrangian and applying mathematical techniques such as [[perturbation theory approximation]], one can make predictions about particle interactions and phenomena at the quantum level.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific form of the Lagrangian depends on the particular field theory being considered. Each field theory, such as the [[standard model]] of particle physics, has its own Lagrangian that encapsulates the properties of the fields and their interactions.\n\n\n\n\nIn [[Quantum Field Theory]] (QFT), the Lagrangian plays a fundamental role in describing the dynamics of quantum fields. The Lagrangian density, which is a function of the fields and their derivatives, describes the interactions and behavior of the fields over [[space-time]]. It incorporates both classical field theory and quantum mechanics.\n\nThe Lagrangian density is used to derive the equations of motion for the fields, known as the Euler-Lagrange equations. These equations describe how the fields evolve in time and space by minimizing the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime.\n\nOnce the equations of motion are obtained, the fields can be [[quantization|quantized]] ([[quantization]]) to describe their quantum behavior. This involves promoting the classical fields to operators that satisfy the commutation or anticommutation relations([[Canonical Commutation Relation]]), depending on the type of field (bosonic or fermionic). Quantizing the fields leads to the creation and annihilation operators, which describe the creation and annihilation of particles associated with the field.\n\nThe Lagrangian density determines the form of the creation and annihilation operators, as well as the rules for their interactions. It encodes the interactions and symmetries of the fields, allowing for a comprehensive description of particle physics phenomena at the quantum level.\n\nIn summary, the Lagrangian density in QFT provides a unified framework for describing the dynamics and quantum behavior of fields. It combines classical field theory and quantum mechanics, leading to a comprehensive understanding of particles and their interactions.\n\n\n\nLagrangians play a crucial role in the description of [[virtual particles]] in quantum field theory (QFT). In QFT, particles are considered [[excitation]]s of underlying quantum fields. Virtual particles, on the other hand, are not directly observable and do not correspond to physical particles in the same way as real particles.\n\nIn the context of QFT, virtual particles arise as intermediate states in particle interactions. They are represented by propagators, which are mathematical expressions related to the amplitude of a particle transitioning from one state to another. The calculation of these amplitudes involves the use of [[Feynman diagrams]], which are graphical representations of particle interactions.\n\nThe Lagrangian density provides the foundation for constructing Feynman rules, which determine the precise mathematical formulas for calculating the amplitudes associated with various particle interactions. The Lagrangian describes the dynamics and interactions of the fields, and it contains terms representing the self-interactions of the fields as well as their interactions with other fields.\n\nBy using the Lagrangian, Feynman rules, and perturbation theory techniques, one can calculate the [[probability]] amplitudes for different particle interactions, including those involving virtual particles. These calculations involve summing over all possible intermediate states and integrating over the momenta of the virtual particles.\n\nIn this way, the Lagrangian plays a central role in the theoretical framework of QFT, allowing for the description and calculation of virtual particles as essential components of quantum field interactions.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Lambda-Cold Dark Matter.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Lambda-Cold Dark Matter.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d0d6d5f64c899e83134e55231672f2c3ec2c7a23a495de8a6e24058473feb084", "text": "Lambda-Cold [[Dark Matter]] (\u039bCDM) is the [[standard model]] of [[big bang]] cosmology, and it describes the universe as being composed primarily of three components:\n\n1. **Dark Energy:** Represented by the Greek letter \u039b (Lambda), dark energy is hypothesized to account for the observed accelerating expansion of the universe.

This problem refers to the fact that the laws of physics as we currently understand them \"break down\" or become infinite at certain points, such as at the moment of the Big Bang, where the entire mass of the universe was condensed into an infinitesimal point of infinite density.\n\nLQC is a proposal to resolve these singularities.

Each contraction ends not in a singularity but in a bounce that triggers the next expansion.\n\nOne of the key features of LQC is the quantization of the area and volume of the universe, similar to how LQG quantizes areas and volumes of space. This quantization suggests that the universe's density cannot exceed a certain maximum value. As the universe contracts, it would reach this maximum density and then bounce back, avoiding the singularity.\n\nAlso, unlike the classical Big Bang theory, LQC provides a natural bridge between the quantum regime of the early universe and the classical regime of later times.

The idea of M-Theory came into prominence in the mid-1990s, largely due to the work of Edward Witten, and has been an area of intense research ever since.\n\nIn basic string theory, as you may know, all fundamental particles are conceived as tiny one-[[dimensional]] strings, instead of point-like particles. The different particles - [[quark|quarks]], [[electrons]], photons, and so forth - correspond to different vibrational modes of the string. All of these strings exist and interact within a 10-dimensional [[universe]] - 9 spatial dimensions and 1 [[Time]] dimension.\n\nHowever, string theory comes in several different versions - Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8xE8). These versions appear to be different, but they are related through various dualities - relationships where the descriptions might look different but are physically identical.\n\nThis is where M-Theory comes in. M-Theory is proposed as a more fundamental theory that unifies all five string theories. It also includes a previously obscure 11-dimensional theory known as [[supergravity]]. The \"M\" in M-Theory doesn't have a specific definition - it could stand for \"membrane,\" \"mystery,\" \"matrix,\" \"mother,\" or \"magic,\" depending on who you ask.\n\nIn M-Theory, strings are still fundamental, but they are joined by higher-dimensional objects known as branes. These [[brane]] can take many forms, from 0-dimensional particles (\"0-branes\") all the way up to 9-dimensional spaces (\"9-branes\"), and everything in between. Strings themselves are viewed as 1-branes, and it's possible for branes of different dimensions to interact in various ways.

In condensed matter physics, Majorana fermions can appear as [[quasiparticle|quasi-particle]] excitations in certain materials, such as topological superconductors.\n\nThe concept of Majorana fermions has attracted substantial interest in the context of [[Quantum Computing]] for several reasons:\n\n1. **[[non-locality]]**: Majorana fermions are believed to be [[non-locality|non-local]] entities that emerge from the collective behavior of many [[electrons]]. Their [[non-locality|non-local]] nature means that they are not tied to a specific location within a material, making them robust against local noise and perturbations.

This [[Braiding]] operation can be used to perform [[Quantum Gates]], forming the basis for [[topological]] quantum computation. This approach to quantum computing is inherently fault-tolerant, meaning it is less susceptible to errors.\n\n3. **Potential for [[Quantum Error Correction]]**: Because Majorana modes are robust against local errors, they could potentially be used to construct a more fault-tolerant form of quantum computation. This has led to the exploration of Majorana modes as a building block for quantum error correction codes.\n\n4. **Challenges and Frontiers**: Despite their promise, Majorana fermions present substantial experimental challenges. Detecting and controlling them in physical systems is an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to confirm their existence and understand their properties. The recent work mentioned earlier from IBM researchers represents one such effort to develop new methods for identifying, verifying, and manipulating Majorana modes.\n\nIn summary, Majorana fermions are intriguing both from a fundamental physics perspective and for their potential applications in quantum computing.

They predict the existence of electromagnetic waves, which travel at the speed of light and include phenomena such as visible light, radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and [[Gamma waves|gamma]] rays.\n\n\nIn a [[Quantum Field Theory]] particles are understood as excitations or \"quanta\" of underlying fields. In fact, the entire [[universe]] is described as a set of fields, each associated with a particular type of particle. The electron field gives rise to electrons, the photon field to photons, and so on. The interactions of these particles are then understood as interactions between these fields.\n\nWhen we look at Maxwell's equations under this lens, they can be seen as the classical field equations for the photon field. They describe how the electromagnetic field, associated with photons, behaves and interacts with electric charges (which, in QFT, would be [[excitation]]s of the electron field).\n\nIn the context of QFT, the quantum version of Maxwell's equations gives rise to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), the field theory describing the interactions between photons and electrically charged particles such as electrons and positrons. QED, a part of the [[standard model]] of particle physics, has been extremely successful and is one of the most accurate theories in physics.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that quantum mechanics and QFT introduce additional phenomena and behaviors not captured by Maxwell's equations alone, such as [[Quantum Entanglement]], uncertainty, and the creation and annihilation of particles. The transition from Maxwell's equations to QED isn't just a matter of \"quantizing\" the electromagnetic field, but also requires dealing with these uniquely quantum-mechanical phenomena.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Mindfulness.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Mindfulness.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "81732a87b1920b706926a5b60a299400e9553ee7fb955cc72cd85a24f297050b", "text": "The practice of mindfulness involves bringing one's attention to the present moment without judgement.

Fermions are characterized by having half-integer spins (e.g., 1/2, 3/2, etc.). The principle states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state if all other quantum numbers, such as position, momentum, and energy, are identical. \n\nThis principle has important implications for the behavior of matter.

It also determines the electronic structure of atoms, the periodic table, and the behavior of electrons in solids.\n\nThe Pauli exclusion principle is crucial in understanding the stability and properties of matter, as it prevents the collapse of atoms and the condensation of fermionic matter into a single state. It also plays a significant role in determining the behavior of electrons in metals, the formation of chemical bonds, and the properties of degenerate matter, such as white dwarf stars and neutron stars.\n\nThe principle is a consequence of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of particles at the microscopic level.

The theory suggests that consciousness arises from quantum processes in the brain.\n\nThe theory proposes that microtubules, which are structural components of cells, may be involved in quantum information processing in the brain. Specifically, the theory suggests that quantum effects within the microtubules, such as [[Quantum Entanglement]] and quantum [[superposition]], may be responsible for generating consciousness.\n\nThe theory has been criticized for a lack of empirical evidence and for its reliance on speculative ideas about quantum physics. However, it has also attracted interest and debate within the scientific community, with some researchers continuing to explore the potential connection between quantum physics and consciousness. \n\nPenrose & Hameroff suggest a connection between brain biomolecular processes and the dynamic, fine-scale structure of the [[universe]], the abyss between this world and the celestial. This does not mean the external is identical with the transcendent. The epistemological cannot be proven as essences of concrete images of the real world, but a means of how we know what we know.\n\nThe hypothesis suggests that quantum superpositions and entanglement within microtubules can reach a threshold called the \"objective reduction\" (OR). OR is a process that involves the collapse of the quantum state to a specific configuration, leading to the emergence of conscious experience.\n\nThe idea is that these orchestrated quantum processes in microtubules contribute to the selection and organization of neuronal activities, influencing the overall functioning of the brain. It is suggested that these quantum processes may play a role in perception, cognition, and the integration of information in conscious experience.\n\nMany researchers in the field of neuroscience and quantum physics remain skeptical of Orch-OR due to the lack of empirical evidence and the theoretical challenges associated with maintaining quantum [[coherence]] at the scale required for conscious processing.\n\nmore on orch-or\n\nTo address the measurement problem, and consciousness, Roger Penrose considered the fundamental question of how a particle can be in quantum superposition of multiple locations simultaneously. He used \u2018microscopic [[general relativity]]\u2019, portraying quantum particles as tiny [[space-time|spacetime]] curvatures, and superpositions as separated, alternative curvatures, governed by a wavefunction.\u00a0\n\nCollapse/reduction caused by subjective conscious [[observation]] (BING!!) is shown in Figure 1a (\u2018subjective reduction\u2019, \u2018SR\u2019). In this view, consciousness collapses the [[wavefunction]], but consciousness is left outside science.\n\nPenrose proposed the precise opposite, that OR collapse occurs spontaneously at time t = \u0127/EG, and (in P-OR) also\u00a0_causes_\u00a0(or is equivalent to)\u00a0a\u00a0conscious moment. In random microenvironments, ubiquitous P-OR moments would be experiential, but isolated, acausal and lacking [[memory]], merely \u2018proto-conscious\u2019 (ping!!, Figure 1b), metaphorically the noise of musical instruments being tuned before a performance.\n\n\n\nIn the mid 1990s Penrose and Hameroff proposed that orchestrated [[quantum]] computations terminating by P-OR occur in microtubules, lattice polymers of the protein 'tubulin', inside brain [[neuron|neurons]]. Dendritic-somatic [[superposition]]s would entangle, evolve, quantum compute\u00a0 and collectively reach OR threshold for full conscious moments, selecting microtubule states which regulate axonal firing and behavior \u2013 \u2018Orchestrated objective reduction, \u2018Orch OR\u2019\u00a0\n\nTo accommodate Orch OR events by t = \u0127/EG, a scalar brain hierarchy was described, both upward in size from [[neuron|neurons]] into networks, but also downward, inward, deeper and faster, to quantum vibrations among electron clouds inside microtubules,9\u00a0and ultimately to fundamental spacetime geometry at the [[Planck]] scale \n\n\n\nThe inward hierarchy was discovered by Anirban Bandyopadhyay and colleagues as self-similar [[patterns]] of microtubule quantum vibrations and resonances repeating in terahertz, gigahertz, megahertz, kilohertz and hertz frequency ranges. Orch OR conscious events are proposed as quantum computations selecting particular microtubule vibrational states, like notes and chords in music, able to control axonal firings and neuronal functions. Thus Orch OR entails \u2018conscious qubits\u2019, e.g. in and among dendritic-somatic microtubules in cortical pyramidal neurons, multiple poised alternatives that can \u2018collapse\u2019 to specific states as the \u2018solution\u2019, selecting a conscious perception or action via axonal firing directly to spinal cord.\n\n\nIn the context of the double-slit experiment, Orch-OR would suggest that the particle's wavefunction collapses not because it is being measured but because it reaches this threshold where gravitational effects induce a spontaneous collapse. However, it's worth noting that the mass-energy levels involved in typical quantum experiments like the [[double-slit experiment]] are far below what would be required for gravitational effects to become significant, according to current understanding.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Penrose.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Penrose.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Perfect quantum portal emerges at exotic interface.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Perfect quantum portal emerges at exotic interface.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Phase-flip errors.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Phase-flip errors.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "18fdcd7e0d240a4ed6871d966e4dbffa77e304a8de0314969a31d3616602125d", "text": "In quantum computing, a qubit's phase refers to a specific type of transformation that doesn't change the probability of measuring the qubit in the state \\(|0\\rangle\\) or \\(|1\\rangle\\), but rather affects the relationships between these states in a superposition. \n\nA qubit can be in a superposition of the $$|0\\rangle$$ and $$|1\\rangle$$ states, represented as:\n\n$$[ |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle ]$$\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are complex numbers, and \\(|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1\\).\n\nThe phase of a qubit refers to the relative argument of the complex numbers \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).

We show that they are all lattice surfaces and we compute the [[topological|topology]] of the associated Teichm\u00fcller curves. Using an algorithm that can be used generally to compute Teichm\u00fcller curves of translation covers of primitive lattice surfaces, we show that the Teichm\u00fcller curve of the unfolded dodecahedron has genus 131 with 19 cone singularities and 362 cusps. We provide both theoretical and rigorous computer-assisted proofs that there are no closed saddle connections on the surfaces associated to the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, and icosahedron. We show that there are exactly 31 equivalence classes of closed saddle connections on the [[dodecahedron]], where equivalence is defined up to affine automorphisms of the translation cover. Techniques established here apply more generally to Platonic surfaces and even more generally to translation covers of primitive lattice surfaces and their Euclidean cone surface and billiard table quotients.\n\nThe passage you've provided seems to be a very advanced and specific discussion of a certain topic in mathematical geometry and topology, specifically dealing with lattice surfaces and Platonic solids. Let's break down some of these concepts:\n\n1. **Unfoldings of the surfaces of Platonic solids**: This refers to the process of taking the faces of a Platonic solid (a three-[[dimensional]] shape where each face is the same regular polygon and the same number of polygons meet at each vertex) and \"unfolding\" them into a two-dimensional plane.\n\n2. **Translation surfaces and Teichm\u00fcller curves**: A translation surface is a type of geometric figure that is invariant under translations, a type of geometric transformation. In other words, if you slide the surface around without rotating or reflecting it, you always get the same surface. A Teichm\u00fcller curve is a certain type of path through the space of all possible shapes that the surface can take on. They provide a way to study the properties of translation surfaces.\n\n3. **Closed saddle connections**: These are paths on the surface that are straight in a certain sense and close up to form a loop. The statement \"there are no closed saddle connections\" means that there are no such paths on the surfaces associated with the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, and icosahedron.\n\n4. **Affine automorphisms**: An affine transformation is a geometric operation that includes translations, rotations, and scaling operations. An automorphism is an operation that maps a mathematical object to itself. So an affine automorphism of the translation cover would be a transformation that preserves the structure of the surface.\n\n5. **Translation covers of primitive lattice surfaces and their Euclidean cone surface and billiard table quotients**: This seems to be a more general topic related to the specific examples given in the rest of the text. It's a little difficult to parse without more context, but it seems to relate to studying surfaces that are obtained from primitive lattice surfaces (which are a certain type of translation surface) and the transformations that preserve them.\n\nIn general, this appears to be a highly specialized discussion of a topic in the field of geometry and topology. This type of work often involves both theoretical proofs and computer simulations or calculations, as suggested by the reference to \"rigorous computer-assisted proofs\".

The original Transactional Interpretation, as conceived by John G. Cramer, uses \"retarded\" and \"advanced\" wavefunctions to form a \"handshake\" across time, thereby establishing a \"transaction\" that determines the outcome of a quantum event. However, TI has been criticized for not providing a clear mechanism for how one transaction is selected over others when multiple transactions are possible.\n\nThe PTI aims to resolve this issue by introducing the concept of \"incipient transactions,\" which are potential transactions that could occur but have not yet been actualized. In this framework, the retarded wavefunction emitted by a source (like an atom emitting an electron) gives rise to multiple incipient transactions with all possible absorbers. These incipient transactions exist in a \"possibility space,\" separate from spacetime, where they can interfere with each other.\n\nWhen a measurement or interaction occurs, one of these incipient transactions is actualized, and its corresponding advanced wavefunction is realized, completing the handshake and forming a real transaction. The actualization of one transaction collapses the wavefunction, consistent with standard quantum mechanics, and eliminates other incipient transactions from becoming real.\n\nKey Features and Implications of PTI:\n\n1. **Resolution of the Measurement Problem**: PTI provides a way to understand the collapse of the wavefunction without invoking an observer or a special role for measurement, thus addressing one of the most puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics.\n\n2. **Non-locality and Entanglement**: Like TI, PTI offers a natural explanation for quantum entanglement. The incipient transactions between entangled particles exist in the possibility space, and the actualization of one transaction instantaneously determines the state of both particles, consistent with experimental results.\n\n3. **Causality**: PTI maintains the time-symmetric formalism of TI but situates the advanced and retarded wavefunctions in a possibility space, thereby avoiding some of the causality concerns associated with advanced wavefunctions propagating backward in time in spacetime.\n\n4. **Determinism and Indeterminism**: PTI accommodates both deterministic and indeterministic views.

It is a fundamental theory of particle physics that governs the interactions between quarks and gluons, the basic constituents of [[hadrons]] such as protons, neutrons, and mesons.\n\nQCD is part of the [[standard model]] of particle physics, which is a framework that explains the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions. The theory is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and the concept of gauge [[symmetry]]. In QCD, the fundamental particles are quarks and gluons, which are elementary particles that carry the properties of color charge and interact through the exchange of gluons.\n\nThe [[strong nuclear force]], described by QCD, is responsible for holding quarks together inside hadrons and for the binding of atomic nuclei. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which decreases with distance, the strong force increases with distance. This property is known as confinement, which means that quarks are never observed as isolated particles but are always found bound together in color-neutral combinations.\n\nQCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, meaning that the gluons carry a color charge and interact with each other. This property leads to a rich and complex behavior of the strong force, including phenomena such as asymptotic freedom and color confinement. Asymptotic freedom implies that at high energies or short distances, the strong force becomes weaker, allowing for a perturbative treatment of [[quark]] and gluon interactions. On the other hand, at low energies or large distances, the strong force becomes stronger, leading to confinement.\n\nQCD has been extensively studied and tested through experiments conducted at particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It provides a successful framework for understanding the behavior of hadrons, the structure of atomic nuclei, and the dynamics of high-energy collisions involving quarks and gluons. The calculations and predictions of QCD are often performed using sophisticated techniques such as lattice QCD and perturbative QCD, which allow for the exploration of strong interactions at different energy scales.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum Computing.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum Computing.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d8db71ca6c0166eec1cc9232a850dd5e4a7bba5067f63bf0bdba9fcb6418e1ac", "text": "---\naliases: quantum computer\n---\n\nA conventional bit in a classical computer can exist in one of two states - 0 or 1. In contrast, a quantum bit, or [[qubit]], can exist in a [[superposition]] of states. That is, it can exist in state |0\u27e9, state |1\u27e9, or any combination of both states at the same time, thanks to a principle known as superposition.\n\nAnother key principle of quantum mechanics used in quantum computing is [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]]. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked in such a way that the state of one cannot be described independently of the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. Entangled qubits can be used to create correlations that cannot be achieved classically and are essential for many quantum algorithms.\n\n[[Quantum Gates]] operate on qubits to change their state. Unlike classical logic gates, [[Quantum Gates]] are reversible and can be represented as unitary matrices. Some common [[Quantum Gates]] include the Pauli-X, Y, and Z gates, the Hadamard gate, and the phase shift gate.\n\nThere are also two-qubit gates, like the CNOT (controlled not) gate, which flips the second qubit if the first qubit is in the state |1\u27e9, and the SWAP gate, which exchanges the states of two qubits. Gates on multiple qubits can be used to create entanglement.\n\nQuantum computers have the potential to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers. For example, Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases, both provide significant speedups over the best known classical algorithms.\n\nHowever, building practical quantum computers is a huge technological challenge. Qubits are delicate and can be easily disturbed by their environment, a problem known as [[decoherence]]. Various approaches to building quantum computers, such as superconducting qubits, trapped ions, [[topological qubits]], and photonic qubits, each come with their own set of challenges. Quantum error correction protocols are needed to make robust quantum computations possible.\n\nGoogle quantum computer:\nyou have the actual qubits as these superconducting pieces of aluminium on a silicon chip which is where the [[Quantum Entanglement]] happens. \n\n\n\nThere are three types of quantum computers with different levels of computation power, Quantum Annealer, Analog Quantum, and Universal Quantum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we can design efficient quantum algorithms for quantum field theories, we can potentially solve problems in particle physics that are computationally challenging for classical computers. Here are some examples where quantum computers might provide advantages:\n\n1. **Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: QCD is the theory that describes the [[strong nuclear force]], which binds [[quark|quarks]] and [[gluon|gluons]] into protons, neutrons, and other [[hadrons]]. A common way to perform non-perturbative calculations in QCD is to discretize [[space-time|spacetime]] into a lattice. This is known as lattice [[QCD]]. Calculating certain properties, like the masses of particles or the matrix elements between states, requires significant computational power, especially as the lattice spacing goes to zero. Quantum computers might provide a more efficient means of performing these lattice calculations.\n\n2. **[[scattering amplitudes]] Calculations**: As mentioned earlier, scattering amplitudes describe the [[probability|probabilities]] of outcomes from particle collisions. While there are clever methods to compute them perturbatively for certain processes, some regimes (like strong coupling regimes) can be challenging. Quantum computers might provide a different avenue for these calculations.\n\n3. **Dynamical Processes**: Many interesting processes in particle physics are dynamical, such as real-[[Time]] evolution of quantum fields, [[quantum tunnelling]] processes, or thermalization. Simulating such dynamical processes can be computationally taxing on classical computers, especially if one wants to go beyond simple perturbation theory.\n\n4. **Condensed Matter Analogs**: Many problems in condensed matter physics are closely related to problems in particle physics. For instance, certain condensed matter systems can be described by QFTs. Problems like finding ground states, phase transitions, or [[topological]] properties in these systems can be computationally hard, especially in strongly correlated systems. Quantum computers might offer a way to simulate and analyze these systems more effectively.\n\n5. **Beyond the Standard Model**: There are theories beyond the [[standard model]] of particle physics that predict new particles and interactions. Simulating and understanding the implications of these theories, especially if they involve non-perturbative effects, could benefit from quantum computational methods.\n\nQuantum computers, once they reach sufficient power and error correction capabilities, have the potential to revolutionize our computational approach to these problems, allowing us to probe regimes of QFTs that are currently out of reach for classical simulations.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum Cosmology.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum Cosmology.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3a9c4f5c54b95c54c1de2ba9ff5c99cb6a677cdc2d20b0c9a8f2d433e3c346e9", "text": "\n\nThe Wave Function of the Universe\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the wave function is a mathematical object that encodes all the information about a system.

However, in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, time is treated as a geometrical parameter rather than an evolving entity, leading to conceptual difficulties.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**: The wave function of the universe is thought to encode the initial conditions of the universe. However, this raises the question of what sets the initial wave function. Different proposals, like the Hartle-Hawking state or the \"tunneling universe\" proposal by Alexander Vilenkin, offer different answers to this question.\n\n3. **Testability**: One of the significant criticisms of quantum cosmology is the issue of empirical testability. Because the wave function describes probabilities for the entire universe, it's not clear how one could perform an experiment to test these probabilities.\n\n4. **Interpretational Issues**: The notion of a wave function for the universe raises questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics. For example, in the Copenhagen interpretation, the wave function is related to the probabilities of outcomes of measurements. But if the wave function describes the entire universe, what constitutes a \"measurement\"?\n\n5. **Multiverse**: Some interpretations of the wave function of the universe lead to the concept of a \"multiverse,\" where each possible history or geometry of the universe is realized in some branch of the wave function. This has its own set of philosophical and scientific challenges.\n\nIn summary, the concept of a wave function for the universe, as described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology, is a fascinating but highly speculative idea. It attempts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity into a single framework that can describe the universe as a whole, but it also raises a host of challenging conceptual, mathematical, and philosophical questions that are the subject of ongoing research.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum Entanglement.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum Entanglement.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a9b56fb90142624f78ca46d30452bfd0674d3fe8b2d2850f836e30518ae5d13a", "text": "---\naliases: quantum entangled, entanglement\n---\n\nFrom the [[EPR Paradox]] suppose you have a particle with total [[spin]] 0, the spin is conserved and decays into two new particles which must have a total spin 1.\nThese two particles are entangled.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles can be so strongly correlated that the state of one particle is instantly influenced by the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This means that the particles are in a single, shared quantum state, and their properties are correlated in such a way that the measurement of one particle immediately determines the properties of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. \n\nIn the context of [[Quantum Field Theory]], particles are described as excitations of quantum fields, and entanglement can occur between these fields. The entanglement can then be spread across space and time, meaning that the entangled particles can be separated by large distances and even over time. This is because in quantum field theory, space and time are treated as part of the same framework, and the entangled particles are described as a single, unified system that exists in this framework.\n\nTherefore, quantum entanglement can be said to \"ignore\" [[space-time]] because the entangled particles exist as a single quantum system that is not limited by the distance between them or by the time elapsed since their entanglement. The entangled particles are described by a single [[wavefunction]], which encodes the [[probability]] of finding each particle in a particular state when it is measured. When one particle is measured, the [[wavefunction]] of the entire system collapses, and the state of the other particle is immediately determined, regardless of the distance between them.\n\n[[Quantum Field Theory]] and quantum entanglement are two fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics that are closely related. In quantum mechanics, entanglement refers to the phenomenon where two or more particles become so deeply entwined that their states are no longer independent of each other. In other words, the measurement of one particle can instantaneously affect the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them.\n\nIn quantum field theory, particles are not treated as individual objects, but rather as excitations of quantum fields that permeate all of space and time. These fields can become entangled, just like particles, leading to entanglement between the particles that are associated with them.\n\nOne way to understand this is to consider the example of two entangled photons. In quantum field theory, photons are treated as excitations of the [[Electromagnetic Field]]. When two photons are produced together, they become entangled with each other, which means that the state of one [[photon]] is correlated with the state of the other. This entanglement is a property of the underlying [[Electromagnetic Field]], which is described by quantum field theory.\n\nIn general, quantum entanglement arises from the fact that the quantum state of a system can be a [[superposition]] of multiple possible states. When two systems become entangled, their combined state becomes a [[superposition]] of multiple possible states, and the measurement of one system can affect the state of the other, even if they are separated by a large distance. In quantum field theory, this entanglement arises from the entanglement of the underlying quantum fields.\n\nFor example, in quantum field theories, [[symmetry|symmetries]] such as gauge symmetries can lead to the creation of entangled particle-[[antiparticles|antiparticle]] pairs. Additionally, the study of quantum entanglement has shed light on the concept of [[entanglement entropy]], which relates to the information content and [[symmetry]] properties of entangled systems.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-big-can-entanglement-get/\nNow, though, physicists are entangling bigger and bigger objects\u2014not just single particles but collections of thousands of atoms. This seemingly-esoteric research could have real technological implications, potentially doubling the accuracy of atomic clocks used in applications such as GPS. But it also challenges the artificial barrier we\u2019ve set up between the microscopic scale, where quantum mechanics rules, and the macroscopic world, where we can count on our intuition. Quantum weirdness is going big.\n\nSo, what happens when you try to scale entanglement up to bigger objects? Maintaining a superposition of states is a very delicate operation. Most particle interactions cause the superposition of states to collapse into a single state, a process called \u201cdecoherence.\u201d Even a stray light particle, a photon, could knock the whole entangled system out of its superposition state and into a single definitive state. This is why we don\u2019t experience this quantum behavior in our everyday life, because pretty much everything we experience has already undergone [[decoherence]].\n\n\nWhen two quantum particles collide they invariably become entangled for the rest of their lives, one impacting the other, no matter where they end up (even if separated across a universe)\n\nBall stated that [[decoherence]] isn\u2019t a matter of a quantum particle suddenly and immediately turning into a classical particle, but our inability to measure and follow desired entanglement as what we are measuring and following entangles with billions of other things around it every second. To merely measure any quantum particle is to entangle the measurement device with the quantum particle. Even if you could theoretically look at a quantum particle with your eyes, the photons bouncing back off the quantum particle and entering your eye to give you vision of the quantum particle would now be entangled with the desired quantum particle.\n\n\nIn principle, when you observe an object, photons (particles of light) bounce off the object and enter your eyes, where they are absorbed by your retinas and trigger electrical signals that your brain interprets as an image. At this point, there is a type of quantum interaction: the photons become \"entangled\" with the atoms in your retina.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum Error Correction.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum Error Correction.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8e13cd3d9f3a98cbe0efb4b0f70a54a9fbd9340605879a85670770747c79b7fe", "text": "**QEC**\u00a0is a theory loosely built on conventional error correction where information is copied and encoded into multiple bits.

In the context of quantum codes, symmetries can reveal a hidden structure or redundancy. A symmetry means that there is some transformation, like a rotation or reflection, that can be applied to the system leaving it unchanged. In quantum codes, understanding these symmetries helps in uncovering the inherent structure of the code and how quantum information is encoded, which is crucial for error correction.\n\n**The Five Qubit Code**: \nOne notable discovery was the five qubit code, which encodes one logical [[qubit]] into five physical qubits. An intriguing property of this code was its myriad symmetries.

This connection underscored that there's a geometric representation to how quantum information is encoded, bridging the worlds of quantum mechanics and geometry.\n\n**Stabilizer Codes**: \nBuilding on these insights, researchers delved deeper and discovered stabilizer codes. These codes are a systematic approach to [[Quantum Error Correction]], where encoded quantum states are described and stabilized by specific operators. The theory of stabilizer codes allowed for a more generalized method to discover and analyze quantum codes.\n\n\n**Grassmannian Encoding of Quantum States**: Given that the Grassmannian structure emerges also in the study of the [[amplituhedron]], one could hypothesize that there's a way to encode quantum states or quantum information in terms of Grassmannian geometries. This would involve seeing quantum states as points or subspaces in some Grassmannian space.\n1. **Error Correction as Geometric Transformations**: If quantum states are seen as geometric structures or points in Grassmannian space, then errors could be visualized as unwanted transformations or deformations of these structures. Quantum error correction would then be the process of geometrically \"correcting\" these deformations, possibly leveraging the structures similar to the amplituhedron.\n    \n2. **Exploring New Quantum Algorithms**: If there's indeed a deep connection between quantum algorithms, Grassmannian geometry, and [[scattering amplitudes]] (via the amplituhedron), then we might find novel quantum algorithms that leverage this connection. For instance, an algorithm that benefits from the simplification of quantum dynamics using amplituhedron-like geometries.\n    \n3. **Unified Framework**: Ultimately, one could dream of a unified geometric and algebraic framework where quantum computations, quantum dynamics (like particle interactions), and quantum error correction are all seen as different facets of a single overarching structure or principle, possibly grounded in Grassmannian geometry.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum Field Theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum Field Theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e18008693e9dd39c3ecd506081c38e90aee7b2ba5012ac7bb409dcfd0f317f0f", "text": "Quantum field theory is a theoretical framework that allows physicists to describe and analyze the behavior of subatomic particles, such as electrons, quarks, and [[photon]]s. In classical physics, particles are seen as [[discrete]] objects that can be described by their position, velocity, and other measurable properties. However, at the quantum level, particles are better understood as [[excitation]]s of quantum fields.\n\nIn quantum field theory, particles are viewed as excitations of underlying quantum fields that permeate all of space. These fields are described by mathematical equations that specify how they change in space and time. The behavior of particles is then described in terms of the interactions between these fields.\n\nOne of the key ideas in quantum field theory is that particles are constantly being created and destroyed. This is known as particle \"vacuum fluctuation\" and it occurs because the fields that particles are associated with are not fixed, but rather they are dynamic and constantly changing.\n\nAnother important aspect of quantum field theory is the concept of \"[[quantization]].\" In classical physics, quantities such as [[energy]] and [[momentum]] can take on any value. However, in quantum mechanics, these quantities are quantized, meaning they can only take on certain discrete values. Similarly, in quantum field theory, the fields themselves are quantized, which means that they can only take on certain values as well.\n\nDespite its complexity, quantum field theory has proven to be an extremely powerful tool for understanding the behavior of particles at the quantum level. It has been used to make highly accurate predictions about subatomic particles and their interactions, and has played a crucial role in the development of modern physics.\n\nQFT has been successful in explaining many experimental results in particle physics, including the interactions of subatomic particles. It has also led to the prediction of new particles, such as the [[Higgs boson]], which was discovered in 2012 at CERN.\n\nOverall, quantum field theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the entanglement of quantum systems, including particles and fields. It allows us to study the behavior of entangled systems and develop new technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, that rely on this phenomenon. However, QFT is not a complete theory and has several limitations. For example, it does not include [[gravity]], which is described by general relativity. Theories that attempt to combine QFT and general relativity, such as [[String theory]], are currently under development.\n\nIn quantum field theory (QFT), the [[Electromagnetic Field]], which includes both the electric and magnetic fields, is described by a [[quantized field]]. \n\n\nIn quantum field theory, there are various fields associated with fundamental particles and their interactions. These fields are [[mathematical constructs]] that permeate all of space and time. Each field corresponds to a specific type of particle and carries certain properties, such as mass and charge.\n\nSome of the well-known fields in quantum field theory include:\n\n1. [[Electromagnetic Field]]: This field is associated with [[photon]]s, the particles of [[light]], and describes the [[electromagnetic force]].\n\n2. Electron Field: This field is associated with electrons, which are fundamental particles with negative charge and play a crucial role in atomic and electronic structure.\n\n3. Quark Fields: Quarks are elementary particles that make up protons and neutrons. There are six types of quarks, each associated with its own field.\n\n4. Higgs Field: The [[Higgs field]] is associated with the [[Higgs boson]], which is responsible for giving mass to other particles in the [[standard model]] of particle physics.\n\n5. Gravitational Field: Although not fully incorporated into the framework of quantum field theory, the gravitational field is associated with the hypothetical [[graviton]], a particle that mediates the gravitational force.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the fields considered in quantum field theory. Each field has its own mathematical description and associated dynamics, which govern the behavior and interactions of the corresponding particles.

It's a fundamental subroutine in many quantum algorithms, including [[Shor's algorithm]] for integer factorization and algorithms for solving certain linear differential equations. Let's dive deeper into the QFT and its significance.\n\n**1. Basics of the Quantum Fourier Transform:**\n\nThe QFT operates on a quantum state, transforming it into another quantum state. For an \\(n\\)-[[qubit]] system in state \\(|x\\rangle\\), the QFT transforms this state as follows:\n\\[ \\text{QFT}|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{y=0}^{2^n - 1} e^{\\frac{2\\pi ixy}{2^n}} |y\\rangle \\]\n\n\n**2. Quantum Parallelism and QFT:**\n\nThe real power of the QFT emerges when combined with the principle of quantum [[superposition]]. When the QFT operates on a superposition of all possible \\(n\\)-qubit states, the result is another superposition where the amplitudes contain information about the [[frequency]] components of the original superposition. This captures the essence of Fourier transforms: revealing the frequency spectrum of a signal.\n\n**3. Shor's Algorithm and QFT:**\n\nShor's algorithm, as previously discussed, relies on finding the period of a function to aid in factorizing integers. The algorithm uses quantum parallelism to evaluate the function at many points simultaneously, resulting in a superposition. Then, the QFT is applied to this superposition to extract the period, which is encoded in the frequency components of the quantum state.\n\n**4. Implementing the QFT:**\n\nIn practice, the QFT can be broken down into simpler [[quantum gates]] suitable for execution on quantum hardware. The QFT can be decomposed into a combination of controlled phase gates and single-qubit Hadamard and rotation gates. This decomposition is essential for actual [[quantum computing]] implementations.\n\n**5. Significance in Quantum Algorithms:**\n\nBeyond Shor's algorithm, the QFT plays a pivotal role in many quantum algorithms. Its ability to transform computational bases to frequency bases is a key tool in the quantum algorithm designer's toolbox. Algorithms like quantum phase estimation, which forms the backbone for many quantum algorithms, rely heavily on the QFT.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe Quantum Fourier Transform serves as a bridge, translating problems from the time (or computational) domain into the frequency domain, just as the classical Fourier transform does for classical signals.

As qubits pass through gates they lose their original state and if that quantum state is needed again a [[qubit]] can revert back to its original form.

While general relativity describes the macroscopic world, particularly the behavior of massive objects and the structure of [[space-time|spacetime]] itself, quantum mechanics is the framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels. The two theories are incredibly successful in their respective domains, but they have proven difficult to unify into a single, [[coherence|coherent]] theory of quantum gravity.\n\nIn classical general relativity, time dilation occurs due to the curvature of spacetime around massive objects. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time passes relative to a distant observer. In [[special relativity]], time dilation also occurs for objects moving at high speeds relative to an observer. However, these concepts are fundamentally classical and macroscopic, and they don't easily translate into the quantum world, where particles can exist in superpositions and become entangled with each other.\n\nThe idea of quantum time dilation introduces the possibility that entangled particles could experience different \"amounts\" of time, even when they are in the same reference frame. This is a radical departure from both classical relativity and standard quantum mechanics. In standard quantum mechanics, particles can be entangled in such a way that the state of one instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them. However, the concept of \"time\" in quantum mechanics is generally treated as an external parameter, not as something that can be entangled or subject to [[superposition]].\n\nIf quantum time dilation were to be confirmed, it could provide a new avenue for understanding the relationship between time, gravity, and quantum phenomena. It might offer clues for how to develop a theory of [[quantum gravity]], which would reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics. Such a theory could have profound implications for our understanding of fundamental physics, including the nature of time itself, the unification of forces, and perhaps even the behavior of singularities within [[black hole|black holes]] or the state of the universe at the time of the Big Bang.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the concept of quantum time dilation is still very much in the realm of theoretical speculation. It has not been empirically tested, and it's not clear how one would go about testing such a radical idea. Moreover, it would need to be reconciled with the existing experimental evidence that supports both general relativity and quantum mechanics, which are among the most well-tested theories in all of physics.\n\nIn summary, while quantum time dilation is a fascinating concept that could potentially revolutionize our understanding of time and the universe, it remains a theoretical construct awaiting rigorous mathematical formulation, experimental testing, and, ultimately, either validation or falsification.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Quantum critical point.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Quantum critical point.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "115043a647e45bc556ad2894f96440e75adb8d0fc3007879f6ec729db22547d5", "text": "A quantum critical point (QCP) is a point in the phase diagram of a quantum system where a continuous [[phase transition]] takes place at absolute zero temperature (T=0).

At this point, it's balanced between different phases, much like a system at a quantum critical point. This would allow for a high degree of complexity and adaptability, facilitating rapid changes in brain states.\n\nSimilarly, [[metastability]], a state of temporary or pseudo-stability before a system transitions into a different state, may also draw parallels with a quantum critical point.

Could the reemergence of quantum-like behavior at these scales offer new insights into these mysterious phenomena?\n\n3. **[[Emergent]] Phenomena**: Physics often exhibits \"emergent\" behavior, where new properties appear at different scales (e.g., thermodynamics emerging from statistical mechanics).

These fermions interact randomly with each other, leading to complex behavior that is difficult to predict. However, despite this complexity, the SYK model is solvable in the limit of large N, meaning that exact solutions can be obtained in this limit.\n\nThe SYK model is considered to be a toy model for studying quantum gravity, especially black hole physics. The reason is that it demonstrates a property known as [[holography]], which is a key part of the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory]]. According to the principle of [[holography]], a quantum system described by gravity in a certain space can be equivalently described by a quantum system without gravity on the boundary of that space.\n\nThe SYK model, despite being a 0+1 dimensional system (meaning it exists in time but is point-like in space), is believed to have a dual description as a 1+1 dimensional system (a system existing in time and one space dimension) with gravity. This higher-dimensional system is a kind of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, which is a solution to Einstein's equations of general relativity with a negative cosmological constant.\n\nThe dual gravitational description of the SYK model is conjectured to capture certain aspects of black hole physics.

It suggests a [[fractals|fractal]] structure of space-time where systems behave differently at different scales. \n\nThe Scale Relativity theory posits that when we look at space and time at extremely small scales, the smoothness of space-time breaks down and becomes a kind of '[[quantum foam|spacetime foam]]', exhibiting [[fractals|fractal]] properties. The geometry of space-time becomes non-differentiable and paths are characterized by a generalized form of the Schrodinger equation.\n\nAccording to this view, quantum mechanics is not so much a 'mechanics' in the traditional sense but a theory of the geometry of space at the smallest scales. It tries to demonstrate that the [[probability|probabilistic]] nature and [[wave-particle duality]] of quantum particles are not intrinsic features of the particles themselves, but a manifestation of the [[fractals|fractal]] geometry of space-time.\n\n[[feynams paths]] come from the inherent randomness of quantum mechanics, while the fractal trajectory in Nottale's theory results from the fundamental scale invariance. The interconnection between these two theories isn't straightforward, but one might see a possible connection in the sense that both theories treat the trajectory of a particle as not being a simple, [[deterministic]] path. \n\nThe theory is highly speculative and has not gained mainstream acceptance. One of the main criticisms is that it lacks solid experimental verification and it's mathematically challenging to make precise predictions with it.

Each lightning burst creates electromagnetic waves that begin to circle around Earth captured between Earth's surface and a boundary about 60 miles up. Some of the waves - if they have just the right [[wavelength]] - combine, increasing in strength, to create a repeating atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann [[resonance]]. This resonance provides a useful tool to analyze Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine what types of atoms and molecules exist in Earth's atmosphere.  \n  \nThe waves created by lightning do not look like the up and down waves of the ocean, but they still oscillate with regions of greater energy and lesser energy. These waves remain trapped inside an atmospheric ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a part of the atmosphere filled with charged particles, which begins about 60 miles up into the sky. In this case, the sweet spot for resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as long, etc) as the circumference of Earth. This is an extremely low [[frequency]] wave that can be as low as 8 Hertz (Hz) - some one hundred thousand times lower than the lowest frequency radio waves used to send signals to your AM/FM radio. As this wave flows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfect spot such that the crests and troughs are aligned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each other to pump up the original signal.  \n  \nWhile they'd been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the early 1960s.

The idea behind Shor's algorithm and its relevance to the period-finding problem is one of the cornerstones of quantum algorithms.\n\n1. **The Function and Its Period**: \n   Let's start by selecting a random number \\( a \\) which is co-prime to \\( N \\) (i.e., gcd(\\( a, N \\)) = 1). We then look at the function:\n\\[ f(x) = a^x \\mod N \\]\n   This function is periodic, which means that after some point, it starts repeating its values. The period (or the length of the repetition) is denoted by \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Importance of Finding the Period \\( r \\)**:\n   If \\( r \\) is even, and \\( a^{r/2} \\neq -1 \\mod N \\), then gcd(\\( a^{r/2} - 1, N \\)) and gcd(\\( a^{r/2} + 1, N \\)) will give non-trivial factors of \\( N \\) (i.e., factors that are neither 1 nor \\( N \\)).\n\n3. **Quantum Parallelism in Period Finding**:\n   Using a [[Quantum Computing|quantum computer]], one can prepare a [[superposition]] of states corresponding to all possible values of \\( x \\) (i.e., the exponent in the function \\( f(x) \\)). This results in a superposition of the function values \\( f(x) \\). The quantum Fourier transform, a central operation in quantum computing, can then be applied to this superposition to extract the period \\( r \\) of the function.\n\n4. [[Quantum Fourier Transform]] (QFT):\n   QFT is analogous to the classical [[discrete]] Fourier transform but acts on quantum states. When QFT is applied to the superposition of states we've created, it makes the period \\( r \\) of the function evident. Specifically, the QFT transforms our initial superposition into another superposition where the states corresponding to multiples of the period \\( r \\) have a much higher probability of being observed upon measurement.\n\n5. **The Classical Part**:\n   Once \\( r \\) is determined using the quantum computer, the rest of Shor's algorithm is classical. We can compute gcd(\\( a^{r/2} - 1, N \\)) and gcd(\\( a^{r/2} + 1, N \\)) to potentially obtain non-trivial factors of \\( N \\).\n\nThis intertwining of quantum and classical methods is what allows Shor's algorithm to factorize numbers exponentially faster than classical algorithms. The classical algorithms for period-finding are exponentially slower, which is why they aren't efficient for large numbers, but the quantum approach rapidly determines the period and thus aids in efficient factorization.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/String theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/String theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3931c7e8fa7f216caa0a2593f84cae8310b4f702a63db689ee4c2c45c4a82025", "text": "---\naliases: cosmic strings\n---\n\nString theory is a theoretical framework in which the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-[[dimensional]] (only have length) objects called strings. The theory aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, which would potentially lead to a unified theory of quantum gravity. This could, in turn, provide a coherent theoretical underpinning for the Big Bang and the [[early universe]].\n\nIn the context of the Big Bang and the early [[universe]], string theory offers several key ideas:\n\n1. **Cosmic Strings:** In string theory, cosmic strings are hypothesized to be incredibly thin, incredibly dense, one-dimensional defects in space-time that could have formed during phase transitions in the early universe. These cosmic strings, if they exist, could have played a role in the formation of large-scale cosmic structures such as galaxy clusters.\n\n2. **Branes and Extra Dimensions:** In many versions of string theory, our observable universe is embedded in a higher-[[dimensional]] space, existing on a \"[[brane]]\" (short for \"membrane\"). There could be multiple branes, and the interaction between them might have led to what we perceive as the [[big bang]]. This concept is explored in models like the [[Ekpyrotic Universe]], where the Big Bang is the result of the collision between two branes. \n\n3. **Pre-Big Bang Scenarios:** Some string theorists propose that the universe existed before the Big Bang. In these models, the Big Bang is not the beginning but rather a transition point or a \"bounce\" from a previous phase of contraction to the current phase of expansion. This idea is explored in models like [[Loop Quantum Cosmology]] and the [[Cyclic Universe]], both of which rely on concepts from string theory.\n\n4. **[[quantum gravity]] and [[Singularity Resolution]]:** The initial [[singularity]] at the Big Bang, where the curvature of [[space-time]] becomes [[infinite]], is a problematic aspect of classical cosmology. String theory, as a quantum theory of [[gravity]], may offer a way to resolve or remove this singularity, similar to how quantum mechanics resolves the [[singularity]] in the center of a hydrogen atom.\n\nIt's important to note that while string theory offers promising ways to understand the Big Bang and the early universe, it's still a theoretical framework that's not yet fully developed or confirmed by experimental data.

One of his central theories is referred to as the Syntergic Theory or \"Tepitoton\", which is about the nature of [[reality]] and consciousness.\n\nThe Syntergic Theory proposes that reality is comprised of a matrix of \"luminous fibers\" or \"emanations\" that permeate the universe. According to this theory, human perception doesn't simply passively receive inputs from the external world. Instead, our consciousness actively selects and organizes certain subsets of these luminous fibers to construct our subjective experience of reality. This process of active selection and organization is what Grinberg-Zylberbaum referred to as \"folding\" or \"unfolding\" reality.\n\nGrinberg-Zylberbaum\u2019s work was heavily influenced by his extensive studies of indigenous Mexican shamanistic practices, particularly those involving the use of the psychoactive plant Salvia divinorum. These practices often involve altered states of consciousness and perceptions of reality, which Grinberg-Zylberbaum integrated into his theoretical framework.\n\nIn his view, reality is a single, unified field of energy and information, and what we perceive as separate entities or events are actually just particular \"folds\" or configurations within this field. This perspective resonates with certain interpretations of quantum physics, as well as with various mystical and spiritual traditions, which also emphasize the fundamental unity and [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] of all things.\n\nSimilar to bohms [[implicate and explicate order]], there's a sense of an underlying reality (the implicate order in Bohm's theory, the luminous fibers in Grinberg-Zylberbaum's theory) from which our perceived, tangible reality (the explicate order in Bohm's theory, the selected subset of fibers in Grinberg-Zylberbaum's theory) emerges or is constructed.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, there is the idea of \"quantum [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]],\" a phenomenon in which pairs or groups of particles can instantaneously affect each other's state, regardless of the distance separating them. This suggests a deep-seated [[non-locality|non-local]] correlation between particles, underlining the interconnectedness of the universe.\n\nSimilarly, Grinberg-Zylberbaum's Syntergic Theory posits an interconnected matrix of \"luminous fibers\" that constitute reality. The way in which consciousness actively selects and organizes these fibers to create our perception mirrors, to some extent, the role of [[observation]] in quantum mechanics. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, it's the act of observation that collapses a wave function (representing all possible states of a quantum system) into a single state. Therefore, [[observation]], or consciousness, plays a significant role in defining reality, a theme that resonates strongly with Grinberg-Zylberbaum's framework.\n\nMoreover, the idea of \"folding\" or \"unfolding\" reality in the Syntergic Theory could be likened to the [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of quantum mechanics, where all potential states exist simultaneously until an observation is made.\n\nhttps://www.resonancescience.org/blog/dr-jacobo-grinberg-a-pioneer-in-consciousness-studies\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/The 'Two-Time' Physics of Itzhak Bars.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/The 'Two-Time' Physics of Itzhak Bars.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "98b704e54bf9527ecfea4c62ef7deb4377f98fdc346aa609d9749a1aa2cc34bf", "text": "gives new meaning to the term two timing bitch \n\nItzhak Bars is a theoretical physicist known for his work on a concept called \"two-time physics.\" In his research, Bars explores the idea of introducing an additional [[Time]] dimension in addition to the familiar time dimension of our everyday experience.\n\nAccording to Bars' proposal, the existence of a second time dimension can provide a new perspective on the fundamental laws of physics and potentially address some long-standing challenges in theoretical physics, such as the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nIn traditional physics, time is considered a one-dimensional parameter that progresses uniformly and independently of other dimensions. However, Bars suggests that introducing a second time dimension can lead to new insights and mathematical formulations that better capture the underlying structure of the physical laws.\n\nBars' two-time physics introduces a framework in which the laws of physics are formulated in a higher-[[dimensional]] [[space-time]] with two time dimensions.

At its core, the theory posits that the fundamental constituents of [[reality]] are not particles or strings, but rather \"conscious agents.\" These agents are endowed with a set of experiences and can make choices based on those experiences. They interact with each other in a network-like fashion, and these interactions give rise to the complex phenomena we observe, including space, time, and matter.\n\nIn this theory, a conscious agent is defined mathematically, with specific properties and rules governing its interactions with other agents. This mathematical rigor is one of the theory's strengths, allowing for precise predictions and potential empirical tests. Each conscious agent has a set of experiences, or \"qualia,\" and a decision-making process that allows it to respond to these experiences. When two or more agents interact, they can combine to form a new, higher-level agent with its own set of experiences and decision-making processes. This hierarchical structure allows for the emergence of increasingly complex forms of consciousness, potentially explaining everything from the simple awareness found in basic organisms to the rich inner lives of human beings.\n\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the Theory of Conscious Agents is its potential to resolve some of the most perplexing puzzles in science and philosophy, including the \"hard problem of consciousness.\" This problem, famously articulated by philosopher David Chalmers, questions why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to the subjective experience of being. Traditional approaches to this question, whether dualist or materialist, have struggled to provide a satisfactory answer. However, by positing that consciousness is fundamental, the Theory of Conscious Agents offers a radically different perspective. It suggests that we've been asking the question backward; rather than consciousness arising from complex computations among brain neurons, those neurons\u2014and indeed, the entire physical universe\u2014are [[emergent]] properties of a network of interacting conscious agents.\n\nThis perspective also offers a new lens through which to view the relationship between the individual and the collective. If each conscious agent is part of a larger network, then the boundaries between individual consciousnesses become more permeable than traditionally thought. This aligns with certain spiritual and philosophical traditions, such as [[Advaita Vedanta]] and some interpretations of [[Buddhism]], which posit a deep [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] among all forms of life and even between life and the inanimate world.\n\nHowever, the Theory of Conscious Agents is not without its challenges and criticisms. One major hurdle is empirical validation. While the theory is mathematically rigorous, it remains to be seen whether it can make predictions that can be tested and falsified through experiment. Another challenge is the integration of this theory with existing scientific frameworks. Physics, as currently understood, provides an extraordinarily successful model for a wide range of phenomena, from the behavior of [[galaxies]] to the interactions of [[subatomic particles]]. Any new fundamental theory, including the Theory of Conscious Agents, would need to show how it can encompass or extend the successes of existing models.\n\nIn summary, the Theory of Conscious Agents offers a bold and mathematically rigorous framework for understanding the nature of reality, placing consciousness at the very center.

This view is different from the common understanding of time in classical physics, where time is considered a fundamental background against which events occur.\n\nOne theory that proposes time as an emergent property is the \"[[Wheeler-DeWitt equation]]\" of quantum gravity. This equation, dating back to the 1960s, has a timeless quality: it can describe a [[universe]] with space but no time.\n\nAnother concept is the \"[[holographic principle]],\" primarily in the context of [[String theory]], where all the information about a volume of space is entirely contained on the boundary of that space, somewhat akin to a [[hologram]]. \n\nUnder the [[holographic principle]], time isn't something that exists \"out there\" in the universe as an independent entity. Instead, time (and space) is a part of the data that's encoded on this 2D surface. So, in that sense, one can say that time \"emerges\" from the more fundamental, underlying physics that's described by the holographic principle.\n\nIn the end, it's important to note that these theories are at the cutting edge of physics and represent attempts to understand the universe at the most fundamental level. They have yet to be empirically verified, and the true nature of time, whether it's fundamental or emergent, remains one of the big unresolved questions in theoretical physics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Time.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Time.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a62a3e64cf0f6afd31e44ecebef111f26f12630eacb23151ea1e5b11f5d01ad6", "text": "The treatment of time in quantum mechanics, particularly the absence of a time operator that stands on an equal footing with position and momentum operators, has a number of far-reaching implications. \n\n1. **Time Evolution**: In quantum mechanics, time is typically treated as a parameter that dictates the evolution of the quantum state via the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. Here, the Hamiltonian (the operator associated with the total energy of the system) is the generator of time translations. This differs significantly from classical mechanics where time is just another variable.\n\n2. [[Energy Time Uncertainty Principle]]: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of observables (like position and momentum) can't both be precisely known at the same time, has an analogue for energy and time. However, this time-energy uncertainty is not as straightforward as position-momentum uncertainty. It often gets interpreted as \"the energy of a system can be uncertain if the time it is measured over is short,\" but this is a very different kind of relation because time, unlike position, does not have a corresponding operator.\n\n3. [[Quantum Time Dilation]]: A recent theoretical development is the concept of quantum time dilation. In this framework, entangled particles can experience different amounts of time passing, even if they are in the same reference frame. This could have significant implications for the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\n4. **[[Problem of Time]] in [[quantum gravity]]**: One of the biggest unsolved problems in theoretical physics is how to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity, our best theory of gravity. This leads to the \"problem of time.\" In quantum mechanics, time is a parameter that progresses uniformly, but in general relativity, time is tied to the geometry of spacetime, which can be warped by matter and energy. How to reconcile these two different views of time is still an open question.\n\n5. **Arrow of Time**: Quantum mechanics, like most fundamental physical theories, is symmetric with respect to time. This means that the basic equations work equally well whether time is going forwards or backwards. This presents a puzzle when we consider the second law of thermodynamics, which says that the entropy of a closed system never decreases. This gives us an \"arrow of time\" - a direction from past to future. How to reconcile this macroscopic arrow of time with the time symmetry of quantum mechanics (and other fundamental theories) is another open question in physics.\n\n\n\n\n\neverything has an [[event horizon]], time has a start and an end \ntime is able to ebb and flow \ntime waves \neverthing is reaching towards a maximum entropy \n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Topological Quantum Computing.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Topological Quantum Computing.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Total Simultaneity.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Total Simultaneity.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "9ed92956121b040d6f8e120c3677ddff7362d462e3cf7da5fc44b85d528a1aa8", "text": "The concept of \"Total Simultaneity\" (TS) as a transformation of the [[Many-Worlds Interpretation]] (MWI) offers a fascinating and expansive view of [[reality]]. In this framework, all possible universes and their respective Eternal Now Moments (ENMs) coexist in a sort of super-reality, a basket of infinite possibilities. This is a radical departure from traditional views that see our universe as a unique, unfolding sequence of events initiated by the [[Big Bang]].\n\nIn the framework of Total Simultaneity (TS), the universe is perceived as a vast, timeless expanse where all possible states and configurations of matter and energy exist simultaneously. This concept aligns with the idea that past, present, and future are not distinct and separate entities, but rather exist concurrently in a higher-[[dimensional]] space.\nNow, if we consider the phenomenon of quantum [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] within this context, we can propose that entangled particles share a unique connection that transcends the conventional three-dimensional [[space-time]]. This connection could be a manifestation of their simultaneous existence in the realm of Total Simultaneity. In other words, entangled particles are intrinsically linked not through physical space or time, but through their shared existence in this timeless dimension.\n\nThe role of [[consciousness]] in this model is pivotal. Divided into Non-Causal Consciousness (NCC) and Causal Consciousness (CC), it serves as the lens through which we perceive and interact with this multi-layered reality. The NCC can be thought of as the timeless, spaceless aspect of consciousness that exists in a state of pure potentiality, while the CC is the localized, time-bound consciousness that navigates the world of [[cause and effect]]. Together, they form a unified, entangled system that generates our experience of reality.\n\nIn this view, matter and space/time are not fundamental but are rather [[emergent]] properties of consciousness itself. This is a profound shift that aligns with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, where the act of observation collapses the wave function and brings a particular reality into existence. If consciousness is indeed the time-creator/traveler, then the implications for our understanding of reality are staggering.\n\nThe idea that all points in space/time are interconnected in TS also offers a fresh perspective on phenomena like quantum entanglement and wormholes. Rather than being mysterious exceptions to the laws of physics, they become natural outcomes of a reality where everything is interconnected at the most fundamental level. This interconnectedness transcends the limitations of algorithmic, [[binary]] thinking and opens the door to a more nuanced, \"grey-scale\" understanding of reality.\n\nThe potential coupling of our brain's neural coding and quantum coherence in microtubules with Quantum Computers could lead to unprecedented expansions of human capabilities. Such a union could extend our sensory perceptions and even enable \"ENM-Hopping,\" a form of experiential time-travel where one could navigate through different ENMs in TS. This would bring our CC closer to the NCC, narrowing the gap between our localized experience and the infinite potentialities of TS. In doing so, we might find that our understanding of spirituality undergoes a profound transformation, as we come to see ourselves not as isolated beings but as focal points of a unified, cosmic consciousness.\n\nIn essence, the TS model offers a vision of reality where the boundaries between science, philosophy, and spirituality become increasingly blurred. It suggests that our current scientific paradigms are not wrong but incomplete, and that a more holistic understanding awaits us\u2014one that incorporates the limitless potentialities of consciousness itself. This is not just a theoretical exercise but a pathway to a new form of existence, where the lines between the possible and the impossible, the natural and the supernatural, the human and the divine, are not just blurred but eradicated altogether.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Transcendence.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Transcendence.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Traversable wormhole dynamics on a quantum processor.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Traversable wormhole dynamics on a quantum processor.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "cbd5b0716423fada844b76a8f8045559d7f01c47fccf7c575cd5ff0c9c80b645", "text": "\na team set out to create a [[einstein-rosen bridges|wormhole]] using jafferis traversable wormhole concept\nthey hoped to design a quantum circuit thats mathematically equivalent to a wormhole\nfirst experiment to prove [[ER=EPR]]  \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3\n\nSurprisingly, a quantum computer is an ideal platform to investigate this connection. The trick is to use a correspondence called [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]], which establishes an equivalence between a theory that describes [[gravity]] and [[space-time|spacetime]] (and wormholes) in a fictional world with a special geometry (AdS) to a quantum theory that does not contain gravity at all (CFT). \n\n\"We can leverage the [[holographic duality]] to create a quantum version of the system. Instead of directly studying the physical system that represents a gravitational wormhole, we examine a set of entangled qubits that undergo the same physics as the wormhole. We can then send a [[qubit]] through the [[Quantum Computing|quantum computer]], simulating its journey through the wormhole. Initially, it seemed impossible because the theoretical requirements suggested a quantum computer that may not exist for another 10 years. However, we decided to give it a try.\n\nIn our GQ2 lab, the controlled signals are generated in the racks next to the cryostat. When we attempted to run the wormhole on a quantum computer, we encountered a significant challenge: the need for a very large system. To overcome this, we employed a technique called coarse-graining, where we preserved the essential gravitational features while discarding unnecessary components. It took some time and experimentation to come up with a solution.\n\nThe breakthrough came when we approached the problem from a neural network perspective. We rewrote the wormhole as [[neural networks]], treating its parameters as neural network weights. We then trained the network on a specific dataset that captured the desired wormhole dynamics. This approach turned the problem into a machine-learning task, allowing us to leverage existing tools and techniques.\n\nI proposed the idea and put it into practice. The original system had 210 terms, but through machine learning, we were able to achieve the same results with only seven terms. The machine learning algorithm preserved the essential aspects of the system while significantly reducing its complexity.\n\nWhen we ran the quantum circuits late at night, we were looking for a peak in the data, indicating the successful passage of the qubit through the simulated wormhole. At first, I was skeptical, thinking it might be just a noise artifact. But as more data came in, the peak became clearer, and it was evident that we had indeed created a wormhole simulation.\n\n\n\nThe qubits of the Google quantum computer create a small space that represents our simulated wormhole. When a pulse of [[negative energy]] is introduced into the wormhole, it becomes traversable and opens up. At this point, we can send a qubit through one side of the wormhole, placing it in the interior.\n\nThe authors showed that a shockwave \u2014 i.e., a deformation of spacetime that propagates at the speed of light \u2014 of [[negative energy]] would solve this problem, propping open the wormhole long enough to enable traversability. The presence of negative energy in a traversable wormhole is similar to negative energy in the [[Casimir effect]], where vacuum energy pushes together closely spaced plates. In both cases, quantum mechanics permits the energy density at a given location in space to be either positive or negative. On the other hand, if the wormhole experienced a shockwave of positive energy, no information would be allowed to pass through.\n\nOnce inside the wormhole, the information carried by the qubit begins to spread throughout the entire quantum system. This spread of quantum information is chaotic and results in complex quantum [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] among many particles. Eventually, the information needs to refocus onto a single qubit.\n\nAs the wormhole starts closing, the qubit exits the system, carrying the refocused information with it. The process of information spreading, entanglement, and refocusing within the quantum system while traversing the simulated wormhole showcases the dynamic nature of the phenomenon.\n\n\n\nAbstract\nThe [[holographic principle]], theorized to be a property of [[quantum gravity]], postulates that the description of a volume of space can be encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary. The anti-de Sitter (AdS)/conformal field theory correspondence or duality1 is the principal example of [[holography]]. The [[Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev (SYK) model]] of N\u2009\u226b\u20091 [[Majorana fermions]]  has features suggesting the existence of a gravitational dual in AdS2, and is a new realization of holography4,5,6. We invoke the holographic correspondence of the SYK many-body system and gravity to probe the conjectured ER=EPR relation between entanglement and spacetime geometry7,8 through the traversable wormhole mechanism as implemented in the SYK model9,10. A [[qubit]] can be used to probe the SYK traversable wormhole dynamics through the corresponding teleportation protocol9. This can be realized as a quantum circuit, equivalent to the gravitational picture in the semiclassical limit of an infinite number of qubits9. Here we use learning techniques to construct a sparsified SYK model that we experimentally realize with 164 two-qubit gates on a nine-qubit circuit and observe the corresponding traversable wormhole dynamics. Despite its approximate nature, the sparsified SYK model preserves key properties of the traversable wormhole physics: perfect size winding11,12,13, coupling on either side of the wormhole that is consistent with a negative energy shockwave14, a Shapiro time delay15, causal time-order of signals emerging from the wormhole, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics16,17. Our experiment was run on the Google Sycamore processor. By interrogating a two-dimensional gravity dual system, our work represents a step towards a program for studying quantum gravity in the laboratory. Future developments will require improved hardware scalability and performance as well as theoretical developments including higher-dimensional quantum gravity duals18 and other SYK-like models19.\n\n\nAccording to the abstract you provided, the research team indeed implemented a quantum circuit mimicking the dynamics of a traversable wormhole as per Daniel Jafferis' theoretical model.\n\nThe Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev (SYK) model, a solvable model of a quantum mechanical many-body system, was used to explore the ER=EPR conjecture. The SYK model has been suggested to have a dual description in terms of a two-dimensional gravity (a realization of the [[holographic principle]]). The researchers used this model to simulate a traversable wormhole dynamics and observe the associated properties such as perfect size winding, coupling consistent with a negative energy shockwave, Shapiro time delay, and scrambling and thermalization dynamics.\n\nThis is a significant step towards testing quantum gravity theories in a laboratory setting. The experiment was carried out on Google's Sycamore quantum processor, a powerful [[Quantum Computing]] device. However, it's worth noting that while the researchers have modeled the SYK dynamics on a quantum processor, this is not the same as creating a physical wormhole or verifying the ER=EPR conjecture in a strict sense. It's a quantum simulation of the dynamics of a traversable wormhole, based on a specific theoretical model (SYK model).\n\n\n\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/wormhole-experiment-called-into-question-20230323/\n\nSize winding is a concept that originates from the study of quantum systems. The concept comes from the notion that different quantum states of a system can be distinguished by their \"size\", a term that can be thought of as the spread or reach of a particular quantum state. Size winding, then, is a way of quantifying how the size of a quantum state changes with time.\n\nThe concept of size winding has been used to investigate the properties of [[black hole|black holes]] and wormholes, objects that are of central importance in the study of quantum gravity. A key insight is that there's a relation between size winding in a quantum system and the behavior of a particle falling through a wormhole, a kind of \"shortcut\" through spacetime predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n\nIn this context, size winding is said to be \"perfect\" when it has a certain mathematical property, indicative of the system being \"scrambled\" by gravity. This scrambling is thought to be a fundamental process in black holes, which are believed to scramble information in a very efficient way, much like a quantum computer. When such perfect size winding is observed, it's taken as a sign that gravity is playing a role in the scrambling process.\n\nThe \"holographic signature\" that's mentioned refers to the [[holographic principle]], a conjecture in string theory that proposes that all the information in a volume of space can be represented by a theory that lives on the boundary of that space. This principle is a key element of the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]], a conjecture in string theory that has provided many insights into the nature of quantum gravity.\n\nThe research mentioned in the statement involves looking for this holographic signature, or \"smoking gun\", of perfect size winding in quantum systems, which would provide evidence for these theoretical ideas about the role of gravity in quantum scrambling and the holographic nature of spacetime.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Untitled.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Untitled.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Wheeler-DeWitt equation.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Wheeler-DeWitt equation.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0b1a3bdb044b9559791e7748e77a45f0c05b8166e67a98d08650072b971ba1ca", "text": "\n\nThe Equation and Its Components\n\nThe Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be written in a form that resembles the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] in quantum mechanics, but with some crucial differences.

These calculations, which used to involve adding up potentially billions of individual terms, are greatly simplified using this geometry. \n\nThe introduction of the amplituhedron was part of a movement to understand the principles underlying quantum field theory in terms of geometric structures, as opposed to the traditional perspective which involves quantizing classical fields. \n\n\nThis geometric object removes two foundational principles of physics\u2014[[locality]] and unitarity\u2014from its foundational assumptions.\n\"[[locality]]\" refers to the idea that particles can only influence each other if they are close together (either in space or in time). \"[[Unitarity]],\" on the other hand, refers to the principle that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes for a quantum event should equal one.\n\nTraditional quantum field theory, which describes the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions, is built upon these two principles. However, both principles break down in certain scenarios involving gravity, leading some physicists to question whether these principles are truly fundamental to the nature of reality.\n\nThe amplituhedron discards these two principles at the onset. It does not require the typical conception of space-time and probabilities. Instead, these features emerge as a consequence of the geometric properties of the amplituhedron. Essentially, the object suggests that the conventional picture of particles moving through [[space-time|spacetime]] is a constructed image, not a fundamental reality.\n\nThe use of the amplituhedron for simplifying calculations is a part of a bigger conjecture known as the \"Amplituhedron Conjecture\" or \"Arkani-Hamed & Trnka\u2019s Amplituhedron Conjecture,\" which asserts a deep structure for scattering amplitudes and their simplification. \n\nThe researchers have found that rather than using the complex, traditional method of [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]], they can use a geometric object - the amplituhedron - to simplify calculations related to particle interactions.\n\nThe idea that we can calculate scattering amplitudes (probabilities of particles scattering in a certain way) directly from the volume of the amplituhedron suggests that our traditional understanding of space-time and the way particles interact may not be fundamental. Instead, these concepts may arise from more abstract, underlying geometrical structures.\n\nThis could have far-reaching implications for theoretical physics, particularly in the search for a theory of quantum gravity, a yet-undiscovered theory that would reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nThe concept of the \"[[master amplituhedron]],\" with an infinite number of facets, is especially interesting. It suggests that there may be a more unified and elegant way to understand all physical processes.\n\nThe [[holographic principle]] posits that all the information in our 3D universe can be represented on a 2D boundary, similar to a hologram. This concept has profound implications for [[black hole|black holes]] and [[quantum gravity]]. The amplituhedron, by removing the principles of locality and unitarity, could be interpreted as suggesting that our usual concept of spacetime (and thus 3D space) is [[emergent]], not fundamental. This is in line with the holographic principle's notion of an [[emergent]] 3D universe.\n\n  \nThe amplituhedron, like the ideas discussed in Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]], fractals, and the holographic principle, challenges our conventional understanding of the universe. The amplituhedron does this by suggesting that space and time are not fundamental components of reality but instead emerge from more basic entities.\n\nIn the context of [[Bohm]]'s ideas, one might view the amplituhedron as a kind of mathematical embodiment of the implicate order. The geometric properties of the amplituhedron hold all the information needed to calculate the outcomes of particle interactions, without reference to localities in space and time (which would be part of the explicate order). Therefore, the amplituhedron is like an \"enfolded\" or \"encoded\" version of the quantum interactions that we observe.\n\nRelating to the [[holographic principle]], the amplituhedron might be viewed as a sort of holographic plate that contains the information necessary to generate the observable universe, or at least the outcomes of particle interactions in that universe. The volume of the amplituhedron corresponds to the [[probability|probabilities]] of quantum outcomes, suggesting that our three-dimensional world with its rules of quantum physics could potentially emerge from this geometric shape.\n\nAs with [[fractals]], where complex structures emerge from simple rules, the complex calculations of quantum field theory become simple when viewed through the geometric lens of the amplituhedron.\n\nFinally, the connections to [[Causal Set Theory]] and the idea of [[emergent]] spacetime lie in the departure from conventional space and time. Like these concepts, the amplituhedron suggests that space and time (and the locality and unitarity principles of [[Quantum Field Theory]]) are not the fundamental descriptors of the universe but rather emerge from deeper, nonlocal, and nonunitary realities.\n\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/\n\n\nThe idea of \"positive geometry\" is central here. Positive geometry is a mathematical concept in which the spaces under consideration are associated with certain positivity properties. In the case of the amplituhedron, the space is such that all its points have positive coordinates and this positivity property ensures that it corresponds to physical scattering amplitudes.\n\nThe phrase \"Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry\" is pointing towards the remarkable aspect of the amplituhedron formulation that the standard principles of quantum field theory, namely [[locality]] (interactions take place at specific locations in spacetime) and unitarity (total probabilities add up to one), do not need to be put in by hand but instead emerge as a result of the underlying positive geometry.\n\nThis shift in perspective from the conventional [[Feynman diagram]] approach to a geometric one is significant as it provides a new way to understand and compute scattering amplitudes, potentially leading to computational simplifications and deeper insights into the structure of quantum field theories.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anandamide.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anandamide.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "82f819f5a8953a2b21ed6a33d2f8aa40252621f574597f3e268d6ba908abea14", "text": "Anandamide is a neurotransmitter that has been shown to be involved in various functions in the body, including [[memory]], appetite, sleep, and pain relief.

Anandamide is able to bind to the cannabinoid receptors in our body, but it is a relatively weak substance that breaks down quickly. \n\nAnandamide is synthesized in various parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and immune system. Specifically, anandamide is synthesized by [[neuron]]s in the post-synaptic terminals and is released into the synaptic cleft where it can bind to the [[CB1]] receptors. The [[CB1]] receptors are densely located in the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and basal ganglia, responsible for regulating pain, appetite, pleasure, and reward. \n\n-   Anandamide and Reward\n\nIn research surrounding anandamide and the reward system it has been found that increasing anandamide, and thus stimulating the [[CB1]] endocannabinoid receptor,\u00a0changes feeding habits and affects free choice. It was observed that when concentrations of anandamide were increased, study participants would opt for the easier, less effortful choice.\n\nThe implications are that anandamide is involved in the body's pleasure and reward system, much like dopamine.\n\nSeveral findings support the hypothesis that the [[endocannabinoid system]] also contributes to the brain reward processes modulating the activity of dopaminergic [[neuron|neurons]], even if indirectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is the case with [[CBD]], anandamide has been shown to be anxiolytic(reduce anxiety)\u00a0 at lower doses and anxiogenic at higher doses, with the former effect involving CB1 receptor activation and the latter effect involving TRPV1 channel activation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486906/#CR70) This indicates that maintaining the balance between CB1 receptor and TRPV1 channel activation is crucial for regulating anxiety, given their opposing anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.

The primary enzyme responsible for anandamide hydrolysis is fatty acid amide hydrolase ([[FAAH]]), which breaks down anandamide into [[arachidonic acid]] and ethanolamine. Other enzymes, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), can also break down anandamide into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Hydrolysis of anandamide limits its duration of action and promotes the restoration of normal physiological function. Inhibiting anandamide hydrolysis can prolong its effects, leading to potential therapeutic applications.\n\n\nThe accumulation of anandamide can lead to dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, which can in turn affect various physiological processes such as [[mood]], pain sensation, and immune function. It has been suggested that an accumulation of anandamide may play a role in the development of certain psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Additionally, an excess of anandamide may lead to impairment in cognitive function and [[memory]] consolidation.\nFor example, in [[ADHD]], the insufficient breakdown of anandamide can lead to a [[dopamine]] deficiency, which is linked to symptoms such as inattention and hyperactivity.\n\nUpregulation of anandamide leads to downregulation of CB1 and CB2 receptors\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anatta.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anatta.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anomalon.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anomalon.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "f4b2aab88f77dc9f2a15331c5f4b04a41c8767736aea8bf74cdc7d6ea4b3165c", "text": "The term \"anomalons\" was introduced in the 1980s to describe unexplained experimental results that appeared to defy established physics. Specifically, they were used to explain observations of unusually heavy and slow moving particles produced in certain high-energy nuclear collisions.

Many of the observations attributed to anomalons could potentially be explained by other, more mundane phenomena. For example, it's possible that the anomalous behavior is due to unknown aspects of nuclear reactions, or perhaps the experiments themselves were flawed in some way.\n\nRegarding Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, they were associated with the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR), and their work focused mainly on studying anomalies associated with human [[Consciousness]] and its possible interaction with physical systems. \n\nthey believe that instead of finding particles we are creating them\nanomalon properties vary from lab to lab\nholographic universe book \n\nhttps://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/1998/03/3123.html\n\nHis results, published today (March 1, 1998) in the British Journal of Nuclear and Particle Physics, provide the first indisputable evidence that anomalons -- which contradict conventional laws of physics -- do exist, but only for a billionth of a second under very specific conditions during nuclear interactions.\nThe results suggest that new and exotic states of matter, such as the H particle, predicted by the [[QCD|Quantum Chromodynamics]] 20 years ago but never found, may finally be detectable.\n\"We have proven the existence of these very abnormal nuclear interactions called anomalons,\" said Jain. \"It is possible that they could be implicated in all the mysteries we have not yet solved, such as the [[quark-gluon plasma]], [[black hole|black holes]] and detection of new, exotic particles.\"\nThe particles are considered abnormal or \"anomalous\" because they are far more reactive and they decay far more quickly than such fragments are expected to, according to the theory of strong interactions.\n\nwikipedia: \nHowever, as study continued the number of negative results continued to grow.

Anyons are neither [[fermions]] nor [[bosons]], which exist in 3 dimensions. Thus, the [[world lines]] of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in [[space-time]]. Anyons can form from [[excitation]]s in a cold, two-dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field, and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminium gallium arsenide. Anyons don't exist in isolation but arise from the intricate interactions in specific condensed matter systems. They encapsulate the collective excitations or behaviors of many underlying particles.\n\nWhen anyons are [[Braiding|braided]], the transformation of the quantum state of the system depends only on the [[topological]] class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified according to the braid group). When two anyons are braided or exchanged, the wavefunction of the system is multiplied by a phase factor that can be anything between 0 and \ufffd\u03c0 (0 to 180 degrees). This \"fractional\" phase is what distinguishes anyons from both fermions and bosons. The concept of \"braiding\" here is a bit abstract. Anyons are excitations or quasiparticles in a 2D material. When we talk about \"braiding,\" we're referencing a series of operations that guide these excitations around one another in a controlled manner. \nIn traditional quantum computing, gates are operations that change qubit states. In topological computing, the act of braiding anyons changes the state of the system. Each braid will cause the wavefunction of the anyons to alter by a phase value which affects the wave function of the whole system or qubit. Each type of braiding operation can be thought of as a different quantum gate. The exact correspondence between a braiding sequence and a quantum gate operation is determined by the anyon's properties and the underlying theory. Using external fields or manipulating the underlying material, researchers can control the movement of anyons. For example, in certain 2D materials, electric or magnetic fields might be applied to move quasiparticles (like anyons) around.\n\nIn traditional quantum computing, the focus is on manipulating individual qubits (often electrons) and their superpositions. Errors occur when these qubits lose coherence.\nIn [[Topological Quantum Computing]], the emphasis is on the braiding of anyons. The quantum information is encoded in the topological properties of the system, which are more robust against local errors. Even if an individual anyon was in a superposition of states, the relevant information is in the braiding. This is why we say the exact state of an individual anyon is less critical\u2014it's their collective braiding behavior that's key. Similarly, the entire system of anyons can be in a superposition of many different configurations or braiding histories. In the case of anyonic systems, the inherent topological protection provides a layer of defense against decoherence, but like all quantum systems, maintaining coherence is still a challenge.\n\nAfter performing a computation by braiding anyons, the result must be read out. This is done by bringing anyons together, allowing them to either annihilate or fuse. The outcome of this process (e.g., whether they annihilate or which fusion path they take) is dependent on the state of the anyons, which reflects the result of the computation. \nWhile it's theoretically possible for different braiding histories to yield the same fusion outcome, the design and choice of anyons for computation are made such that the desired operations have distinguishable outcomes. This is a complex interplay of the properties of the anyons, their initial configuration, and the braiding operations performed.\n\n- **Initial Configuration as Input**: Before computation begins, anyons are initialized into a specific configuration. This configuration is chosen to represent the initial data or state of the computation, much like setting the initial values of qubits in a traditional quantum computer.\n    \n- **Braiding as Computation**: Each braiding operation can be thought of as a transformation of the quantum state, akin to how gates transform qubits in standard quantum computers. A sequence of braiding operations, then, constitutes a computation, transforming the initial state (input) to some final state.\n    \n- **Reading as Output**: After the braiding operations are performed, the anyons are fused. The fusion outcome, whether it's the type of anyon produced or the result of annihilation, is the output of the computation. This is interpreted based on how the system was designed. For example, if a certain fusion outcome is expected for a particular computation (like the result of a function), then obtaining that outcome would indicate that the function returned a specific value.\n\n\n\n\n- \nAlright, let's delve into this concept. The idea of braiding anyons leading to a phase shift in their wavefunction is central to their behavior, and this feature distinguishes them from more common fermions and bosons.\n\nFirstly, let's understand the concept of a phase factor in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the overall phase of a wavefunction is not observable. This means that if \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is a valid wavefunction, so is \\( e^{i\\theta} |\\psi\\rangle \\) for any real value of \\( \\theta \\). However, relative phases (i.e., the phase difference between two terms in a superposition) are meaningful and can have observable effects.\n\nFor Abelian anyons (let's begin with these simpler anyons first), the act of exchanging or braiding two of them can introduce a phase factor. Mathematically, let's say that you start with the wavefunction \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\). After braiding two anyons, the wavefunction may transform like:\n\n\\[ |\\psi'\\rangle = e^{i\\theta} |\\psi\\rangle \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is a real number between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\pi \\). This phase factor is directly related to the anyonic statistics and is a result of the quantum mechanical properties of the system in which the anyons exist.\n\nFor non-Abelian anyons, the situation is more intricate. When you exchange two non-Abelian anyons, the result isn't merely a phase factor on the original wavefunction. Instead, the wavefunction can transform into a superposition of several possible states, each with its own phase. The specific way in which this happens depends on the properties of the anyons and their previous braiding history.\n\nThe reason anyons behave this way is rooted in the topological properties of the system they're a part of. Unlike particles in three-dimensional space that acquire a \\( 2\\pi \\) phase upon full exchange (as in fermions or bosons), in two-dimensional systems (where anyons are typically discussed), particles can acquire any phase between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\pi \\) during such an exchange.\n\nTo tie this into the real-world implications: This phase factor, especially in the case of non-Abelian anyons, is what allows for the potential use of anyons in topological quantum computing. The act of braiding can, in principle, be used to perform quantum gates due to these phase changes, which would constitute quantum operations on the encoded information.\n\nHOW DOES EQUATION\n\nTo understand how topological quantum computing can answer a mathematical question, let's contextualize the process in a more familiar scenario: classical and traditional quantum computing. Both, in essence, manipulate information to derive an output. The unique trait of topological quantum computing is its use of braiding anyons, but the underlying goal is still to execute algorithms that give desired solutions.\n\n**1. Encoding the Problem:**\n\nFirstly, any mathematical problem we wish to solve on a quantum computer needs to be translated into a quantum algorithm, similar to how problems are translated into classical algorithms for classical computers. For topological quantum computers, this means representing the problem in terms of anyon configurations and braiding sequences.\n\n**Example:** Suppose we wish to solve a simplified version of the factoring problem (a famous problem in quantum computing). Given a composite number \\( N \\), find its prime factors. We would encode \\( N \\) in the initial configuration of the anyons, similar to how the number might be encoded in qubits in a circuit-based quantum computer.\n\n**2. Executing the Algorithm:**\n\nNext, the algorithm is executed. In traditional quantum computing, this would involve applying a series of quantum gates. In topological quantum computing, this involves braiding the anyons in specific sequences.\n\n**Example:** For our factoring problem, a series of braiding operations would be performed that, due to the quantum properties of the system, simultaneously explore many possible factorizations of \\( N \\). \n\n**3. Decoding the Solution:**\n\nAfter the algorithm has been executed, we need to extract the answer. For topological quantum computing, this is done by fusing anyons and interpreting the results. The fusion outcome is dependent on the braiding operations performed, and by designing our system and algorithm correctly, this outcome will give us information about the solution to our problem.\n\n**Example:** After the braiding operations, we fuse the anyons and observe the outcome. The result will be related to a possible factorization of \\( N \\). Multiple runs of the algorithm may be required to get a high-confidence answer.\n\n**4. Interpreting the Result:**\n\nThe final step is translating the quantum result back into the language of the original mathematical problem. This involves interpreting the outcome of the fusions (or the quantum measurement results) to derive meaningful answers.\n\n**Example:** The outcome of the anyon fusion could point us to a number \\( p \\) that is a factor of \\( N \\). We then use classical methods to verify and potentially derive other factors.\n\nIn essence, just as classical algorithms are sequences of logical operations designed to solve a problem, quantum algorithms (including those for topological quantum computers) are sequences of quantum operations (like braiding) designed to solve a problem. The challenge lies in designing and understanding these quantum operations and interpreting their outcomes in the context of the original mathematical question.\n\nThe simultaneous exploration of many possible factorizations of \\( N \\) (or other solutions to problems) in quantum computers is rooted in the principle of superposition, one of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics.\n\n1. **Superposition**: Quantum bits, or qubits, differ from classical bits in that they can exist in a combination of both \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) states simultaneously, a condition known as superposition. When a qubit is in superposition, it can be represented as:\n\n\\[ |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are complex numbers that determine the probability of measuring the qubit in either the \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) state.\n\n2. **Entanglement**: When multiple qubits are involved, they can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit depends on the state of another. This creates a multi-qubit system where all possible combinations of qubit states exist simultaneously. For \\( n \\) qubits, there are \\( 2^n \\) possible states.\n\n3. **Quantum Parallelism**: This phenomenon of qubits being in multiple states at once allows quantum computers to explore all these states in parallel. For a quantum algorithm, this means that it can process a vast amount of information simultaneously. For the factoring problem, a quantum system can effectively evaluate many potential factorizations of \\( N \\) in parallel.\n\n4. **Shor's Algorithm**: As a concrete example, [[Shor's algorithm]] is a quantum algorithm that can factorize a number \\( N \\) exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. At a high level, the algorithm doesn't directly compute the factors but finds the period of a function related to \\( N \\), which can then be used to efficiently find the factors of \\( N \\). The quantum portion of the algorithm leverages quantum parallelism to find this period much faster than classical methods.\n\nIn essence, the power of quantum computing, especially for specific problems like factorization, comes from the ability to use superposition and entanglement to explore a vast solution space simultaneously, dramatically speeding up computations that would be infeasible for classical computers.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/arachidonic acid.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/arachidonic acid.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "30d1c29a0e2b8c78748b24625d187164b4927fa1a43a1ad658bf32cffb51c550", "text": "Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that is essential for human health.

Now imagine trying to do it while on a roller coaster. That's a little bit like what dealing with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can feel like. So, what's at the root of this wild ride? Recent studies are  pointing towards the involvement of the endocannabinoid system, particularly the role of anandamide, in the development of ADHD symptoms.\n\nAnandamide is a neurotransmitter and part-time social butterfly that's busy interacting with all sorts of processes in our bodies - including mood regulation, pain sensation, and immune function. It has earned the nickname \"bliss molecule\" due to its role in making us feel happy.\nIt is synthesized in various parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and immune system, and particularly in neurons in the post-synaptic terminals (receiving ends of neurons). Once synthesized, it is released into the synaptic cleft, which is the space between the neurons. There, it binds to CB1 receptors, which are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia - areas responsible for regulating pain, appetite, pleasure, and reward. This action of anandamide is part of the endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes.\n\n\nStudies suggest that in people with ADHD, the activity of an enzyme known as FAAH, responsible for breaking down anandamide, is reduced, therefore our levels of anandamide are too high and our endocannabinoid system is out of balance. When the breakdown of anandamide is insufficient, this can lead to dopamine deficiency, which affects mood, pain sensation, memory, and immune function. It has been suggested that an accumulation of anandamide may play a role in the development of certain psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. When anandamide levels increase, it can lead to a downregulation or decrease in the number of available CB1 and CB2 receptors. Heavy cannabis use has been associated with downregulation or a decrease in the density of CB1 receptors in certain brain regions.\n\n\nInterestingly, anandamide also has a significant role in our brain's reward system, comparable to the famous neurotransmitter dopamine. \n\"\"When anandamide levels are high, it seems to guide our decisions, often tipping the scales towards the easier, less effortful choice. \"\"\nSeveral findings support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system also contributes to brain reward processes by modulating the activity of dopaminergic neurons.\n\n\nThere's another player in the mix - cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive member of the cannabis family. CBD is able to modulate GABA activity, a neurotransmitter responsible for dialing down neuronal excitability, which in turn increases dopamine production. CBD also stimulates adenosine receptors, which further promote dopamine release although it's important to keep in mind CBD also increases anandamide. \n\nIn recent years, the popularity of plant medicines such as maca and cacao has skyrocketed. \nThese natural remedies work through our endocannabinoid system by inhibiting FAAH and increasing andamide. \nFor individuals who are neurotypical, FAAH inhibitors like maca and cacao, but also echinacea, green tea and ginger can lead to increased levels of anandamide. These effects may include enhanced mood, reduced anxiety, and an overall sense of relaxation. However, it's important to note that the response to FAAH inhibitors can vary from person to person.\n\nIf you have ever participated in a plant medicine ceremony or consumed maca and cacao, you may have noticed that the effects differ from those reported by others. Some individuals may experience subtle or even unnoticeable effects, while others may not feel the euphoric buzz typically associated with FAAH inhibition. This discrepancy could be attributed to ADHD but also individual differences in metabolism, differences in sensitivity to anandamide, or other factors that influence the body's response to FAAH inhibition.\n\nIn opposition to FAAH inhibitors we have FAAH promoters. Here are some natural substances that have been investigated for their potential to promote FAAH activity:\n\n1. Omega-3 fatty acids: Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may enhance FAAH activity. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), flaxseeds, and walnuts. Hemp seeds are well-known for their optimal omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, making them an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids for supporting the endocannabinoid system.\n    \n2. Curcumin: Curcumin is a bioactive compound found in turmeric. Some research suggests that curcumin may indirectly enhance FAAH activity by reducing the levels of anandamide transporter proteins, thus promoting the availability of anandamide.\n\n\nUnderstanding ADHD is like trying to solve a complex puzzle with many intricate pieces. Anandamide, the endocannabinoid system, and ADHD are all parts of this jigsaw. As we uncover more about these components and how they interconnect, we get a clearer picture of ADHD as a whole.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.Gray, J. M., Vecchiarelli, H. A., Morena, M., Lee, T.

It is made up of seven layers, with the inner layers closest to the physical body comprised of the densest energy, and each succeeding layer being of finer and higher vibrations. Most people have an oval (elliptical) aura, which is slightly larger at the back than at the front and fairly narrow at the sides, and it also stretches above the head and below the feet.

This research aims to discern if and how these networks might differ from those found in neurotypical individuals.\n\nHere are some points of interest:\n\n1. **Atypical [[Connectivity]]**: Some studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have found that individuals with autism may show atypical [[patterns]] of connectivity between different areas of the brain. One hypothesis is that individuals with autism may have an overconnectivity within certain local brain networks (for instance, within one hemisphere) but underconnectivity between different brain regions or between the two hemispheres. This could potentially contribute to some of the strengths and challenges seen in autism. For example, enhanced local connectivity might lead to heightened abilities in specific areas, like attention to detail, while reduced long-range connectivity could contribute to difficulties with integrating information, such as challenges in social communication. ([[hemi-sync]])\n\n2. **Default Mode Network ([[DMN]])**: The DMN is a network of brain regions that is typically active during introspective states such as daydreaming or thinking about the future. It has been found to show atypical connectivity in some people with autism. Some theories propose that alterations in the DMN might contribute to characteristics of autism, such as difficulties with social interaction or theory of mind (understanding others' mental states).\n\n3. **Use of Machine Learning**: Researchers have used [[neural networks]] (a type of machine learning) to analyze brain imaging data from individuals with autism. The goal is to identify patterns that might be associated with autism, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis. It's important to note that while these approaches show promise, they're still in the early stages of development.\n\n4. **Neural Synchrony**: Some research has suggested that people with autism may show differences in neural synchrony - the timing of activity across different [[neuron|neurons]] or brain regions. This could potentially affect the efficiency or effectiveness of information processing in the brain.\n\n5.  **Altered Oscillatory Activity**: Studies have found that individuals with autism may have altered patterns of oscillatory activity. This could include differences in the power and synchrony of various brain wave frequencies, such as delta, [[theta waves|theta]], [[Gamma waves|gamma]], beta, and [[alpha waves]]. Each of these frequencies is associated with different cognitive and behavioral states.\n    \n6.  **[[Gamma waves|gamma]] Oscillations**: Some research has pointed to potential alterations in gamma oscillations in individuals with autism. Gamma oscillations are thought to be involved in higher cognitive functions such as attention, perception, and [[memory]]. Alterations in gamma oscillations could potentially contribute to some of the cognitive and perceptual differences associated with autism.\n    \n7.  **Interhemispheric Synchronization**: There is evidence suggesting that individuals with autism may have decreased synchronization between the two hemispheres of the brain. This is potentially due to differences in the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers responsible for transmitting information between the two hemispheres. This could affect the coordination of neural oscillations between the two sides of the brain.\n    \n8.  **Role in Sensory Processing and Integration**: Altered neural oscillations could contribute to the sensory processing differences often seen in autism, such as hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli. The brain uses these oscillations to integrate information from different senses, and disruptions to this process could lead to difficulties interpreting and responding to sensory information.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/axion.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/axion.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "1e1e6fabd8fabfe6e5ea3f8cd66042cd8816ae79f7bd116b17a534777fdeb476", "text": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were proposed by physicists in the late 20th century to resolve a problem in [[QCD|quantum chromodynamics]] ([[QCD]]), a theory that describes the [[strong nuclear force]] - one of the four fundamental forces of nature that binds protons and neutrons together in the nuclei of atoms.\n\nThe problem, known as the \"[[strong CP problem]],\" refers to the puzzling fact that QCD seems to predict that there should be a large amount of observable electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron. However, experimental results show that the neutron EDM is very small, if not zero. The axion, proposed by Roberto Peccei and Helen Quinn, is a particle that emerges from a mechanism designed to resolve this problem.\n\nNot only does the axion solve the [[strong CP problem]], it is also a candidate for [[Dark Matter]], the mysterious substance that makes up about 85% of the matter in the [[universe]] but does not interact with light or the other known forces, except for [[gravity]].\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, axions have not yet been detected directly.

This unified force is believed to have existed at extremely high energies and temperatures.\n\nAt the beginning of the Big Bang, the energy is believed to have been extremely high and concentrated, but whether it was truly infinite or finite is still a topic of scientific investigation and theoretical speculation. [[unknown]]\n\nAs the [[universe]] expanded and cooled down, undergoing a process known as cosmic inflation, the unified force began to break apart into the distinct forces we observe today. This process is referred to as [[symmetry breaking]] or symmetry breaking phase transitions.\n\nThe first force to separate from the unified force was [[gravity]], which is believed to have remained separate throughout the evolution of the universe. As the universe continued to cool, the strong nuclear force and the electroweak force (a combination of [[electromagnetism]] and the weak nuclear force) also became distinct forces.\n\nThe final separation occurred when the universe cooled even further, and the electroweak force itself broke into two separate forces: [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak nuclear force]]. This [[phase transition]] is thought to have occurred around 10^\u221212 seconds after the Big Bang.\n\n[[String theory]] provides a potential framework for unifying all the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, into a single theoretical framework.\n\nThe exact mechanisms and details of these symmetry breaking phase transitions are still an active area of research and are the subject of ongoing scientific investigation. [[unknown]]The study of particle physics and the early universe helps us understand how these fundamental forces emerged and how they shaped the evolution of the universe as we know it. \n\nIn the context of the Big Bang and the early universe, phase transitions refer to changes in the state of the universe as it cooled and expanded. The term \"symmetry breaking\" refers to the idea that, at extremely high energies and temperatures, all the fundamental forces of nature (except gravity) were unified and indistinguishable from each other. As the universe expanded and cooled, these forces separated out in a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions, each one corresponding to a specific temperature and energy scale.\n\nHere's a rough sequence of these transitions:\n\n1. **Grand Unification Epoch:** Immediately after the Big Bang, during the first 10^-43 seconds, the universe was in a state where all the forces (except gravity) were unified into a single force. This epoch ended with the breaking of this [[grand unified theory]] (GUT) [[symmetry]], when the strong nuclear force separated from the electroweak force. This phase transition is hypothesized to have produced [[magnetic monopoles]].\n\n2. **Electroweak Epoch:** Following the GUT symmetry breaking, the universe entered the electroweak epoch, during which the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces were still unified as the electroweak force. This epoch lasted until around 10^-12 seconds after the Big Bang. The Higgs field, associated with the Higgs boson, also came into play during this epoch, giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism.\n\n3. **Electroweak Symmetry Breaking:** Around 10^-12 seconds after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for the electroweak force to break down into the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force, a transition known as electroweak symmetry breaking. This phase transition is believed to have led to a brief period of rapid expansion known as cosmic inflation.\n\n4. **Quark Epoch and [[QCD]] Phase Transition:** Following the electroweak symmetry breaking, the universe was filled with a hot, dense [[quark]]-[[gluon]] plasma. As the universe continued to cool, around a microsecond after the Big Bang, quarks and [[gluon|gluons]] combined to form hadrons (like protons and neutrons) in a phase transition called the [[QCD]] (quantum chromodynamics) phase transition. \n\nThese phase transitions are not yet fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research in cosmology and particle physics. [[unknown]]They also have implications for the large-scale structure of the universe and the [[matter-antimatter asymmetry]] we observe today. It's important to note that these descriptions are based on current theories and models, which may be refined or revised as our understanding of the universe evolves.\n\n\n\n1. **[[Quantum Cosmology]] and the Beginning of [[Time]]**: If we try to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole, we run into questions about the nature and origin of [[Time]] itself. For example, the [[Hartle-Hawking \"no boundary\" proposal]] suggests that the universe may have originated from a purely quantum mechanical state, with no clear moment of \"beginning\". In this model, [[Time]] as we know it only emerges when the universe becomes large enough for classical physics to be a good approximation.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/binary to spectrum.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/binary to spectrum.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8916048d4d154bf4bc27dc87cacb2800e225dfac2bff09ed90eef08388006b28", "text": "binary to spectrum \nis like \nbit to [[qubit]] \n\nWhen you move from binary to a spectrum, it's like considering the entire \"[[stream|sea]] of electrons\" in a metal, where it becomes more difficult to talk about individual electrons and their specific states. Instead, physicists often discuss the collective behavior of the electrons. This can be seen as analogous to a spectrum, where instead of having [[discrete]] values, there is a continuous range of possible values.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the behavior of a large collection of particles like a \"sea of electrons\" can be described using wavefunctions and fields. The concept of a qubit in [[Quantum Computing]] also uses these principles, allowing qubits to exist in a superposition of states, somewhat analogous to a spectrum of possibilities.\n\n\nThe comparison between [[binary]] to spectrum and bit to qubit is an interesting analogy to illustrate the fundamental differences between classical computing and quantum computing.\n\n1. Binary to Spectrum: Binary code is the most basic form of information in computing and digital communications. The binary system's base 2 number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1. This is straightforward and easy to manipulate with simple electronic hardware. \n    \n    Now, let's consider spectrum, where instead of two distinct states (0 and 1), you have a continuous range of states. Instead of flipping between off and on, you can dial the knob to any value between off and on, providing a whole range of possible values. It's analogous to having a dimmer switch instead of a simple light switch.\n    \n2. Bit to Qubit: A classical bit in computing can be either a 0 or a 1, similar to the binary code. In contrast, a quantum bit, or qubit, isn't limited to being just a 0 or a 1. It can be in any proportion of both states at once due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.\n    \n    Moreover, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, no matter the distance between them, thanks to a property called [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]]. This isn't something seen in classical bits and it allows quantum computers to process a high number of possibilities simultaneously.\n    \n\nSo, just like the transition from binary to spectrum involves going from discrete values to a continuous range, the transition from bit to qubit involves going from discrete, distinct states to a superposition of states.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/binary.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/binary.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "437ed7e13bc261e728f81d2a23ff08f39e9727224affcf47f7a5d44bc0d7531c", "text": "1 0 \nyin yang \nfeminine masculine \nmoon sun \nyes no \ngood bad \nblack white\nnegative charge positive charge \ndiscreet indiscreet \nimplicate explicate\nfluid solid\npast future \nleft brain right brain \nmental physical\nindividual collective\nlife death\n\n([[polarity]])\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/biophoton field.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/biophoton field.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "11be7aca572d648f9e146f93ab9af746a364719cf48ac81880c28fa89ce4f9ba", "text": "The term \"biophoton\" is used in the field of biophysics to refer to the electromagnetic waves, or photons, that are emitted by biological systems.

According to classical general relativity, information that falls into a [[black hole]] is thought to be permanently lost, leading to a violation of the principles of quantum mechanics, which dictate that information should always be conserved.\n\nSeveral proposed solutions have been put forward to reconcile this paradox and preserve the principles of quantum mechanics. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n1. **[[Hawking Radiation]] and [[soft hair theorem]]**: Proposed by Stephen Hawking, this theoretical prediction suggests that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]]. This emission, over time, can cause the black hole to evaporate completely. The information that fell into the black hole is thought to be encoded in this radiation, implying that the information is not truly lost. The later \"soft hair\" theorem suggests additional properties of black holes that could help in the encoding and recovery of this information.\n    \n2. **Quantum Teleportation**: This resolution suggests that information falling into a black hole can be quantum-teleported to another location, thus preserving the information.\n    \n3. **Black Hole [[Complementarity]]**: Proposed by Leonard Susskind, this resolution suggests that information is duplicated at the [[event horizon]], so that it's both reflected back into the universe and also falls into the black hole. This would mean that information is not lost, but it raises its own paradoxes, such as the clone paradox (as it appears to violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] of quantum mechanics).\n    \n4. **[[ER=EPR]] Correspondence**: Proposed by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind, it links Einstein's description of wormholes (ER or [[einstein-rosen bridges]]) with [[Quantum Entanglement]] (EPR or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox). According to this correspondence, entangled particles are connected by a [[einstein-rosen bridges|wormhole]], and the information could travel through these wormholes, thus not being lost.\n    \n5. **The [[holographic principle]]**: It states that all the information contained in a volume of space can be represented as information on the boundary of that space. It implies that the information swallowed by the black hole is somehow stored on the event horizon and can be recovered.\n    \n6. **Firewall Proposal**: Some theorists suggest that there might be a \"firewall\" at the event horizon that destroys incoming information, thereby resolving the paradox but at the cost of giving up the equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity.\n\n7. Quantum Gravity Approaches: Some theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[String theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]], aim to provide a consistent framework for understanding both quantum mechanics and gravity. These theories are still under development and exploration, but they may potentially provide insights into the resolution of the information paradox by incorporating quantum effects into the description of black holes.\n\nIt's important to note that the black hole information paradox remains an active area of research, and no definitive solution has been universally accepted at this time. Scientists continue to explore various theoretical frameworks and experimental observations to gain a deeper understanding of black holes and their behavior within the framework of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/a-visual-information-paradox/\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/black hole.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/black hole.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "08e0e2f6edf01dbae391545cfbef867744e32568306edf8a967119b55a9c8a97", "text": "---\naliases: black holes\n---\n\nBlack holes are objects in space with a mass so great that they attract everything that comes within a certain distance of them. Nothing that comes too close can escape, not even light. But at a [[criticality|critical]] distance, a light beam no longer spirals into the black hole. Rather, it dramatically bends and comes back to its original position, forming a circular orbit. A barrier surface formed by closed light orbits is called a\u00a0[[photon\u00a0sphere]] in Einstein\u2019s theory of [[general relativity]].\n\nThe horizon of a black hole forms a light cone, emerging from a collapsed star. When it comes to black holes, their extreme gravity distorts spacetime to the point that once an object passes the [[event horizon]] -- the boundary of the black hole -- all of its future light cones point towards the black hole's singularity, the region of infinite density at its center. The event horizon of a black hole is essentially a boundary separating regions of spacetime from which light cones can either escape to distant regions of the universe (the outside of the event horizon) or are confined to terminate at the black hole singularity (the inside of the event horizon).\n\nThe behavior of time and space inside a black hole is an intriguing consequence of General Relativity. Outside the event horizon of a black hole, we can think of the time dimension as \"pointing\" out of the black hole, while the space dimensions can be thought of as \"circling\" around it. In this region, we experience time as always moving forward, while we can move freely in space.\n\nHowever, when you cross the event horizon, this situation changes. The intense gravity of the black hole causes a twist in the fabric of spacetime so extreme that the roles of time and space essentially switch. Inside the event horizon, the dimension that was once time now behaves more like a spatial dimension, and what were once spatial dimensions behave more like time. \n\nIn more practical terms, this means that just as we are inexorably carried forward in time in our everyday lives, once inside the event horizon of a black hole, everything is carried inexorably towards the singularity at the center. It's as though the singularity is in your future and, just as you can't avoid tomorrow, you can't avoid the singularity. In this sense, falling into the singularity is more like moving forward in time than moving in space.\n\nThis is a highly non-intuitive result and is one of the many fascinating predictions of General Relativity that challenges our common-sense understanding of how the universe works. Keep in mind that all of this is based on our current understanding of physics and might be subject to change as we refine our theories and conduct more observations of black holes.\n\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/ocean-eddies-mathematically-equivalent-black-holes/\nHaller and Beron-Vera discovered similar closed barriers around select ocean [[eddies]]. In these barriers, fluid particles move around in closed loops \u2013 similar to the path of light in a photon sphere. And as in a black hole, nothing can escape from the inside of these loops, not even water.\nIt is precisely these barriers that help to identify [[coherence|coherent]] ocean eddies in the vast amount of observational data available. According to Haller, the very fact that such coherent water orbits exist amidst complex ocean currents is surprising.\n\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2014-06-gravitational-fields-black-holes-eddy.html\nNew research shows that gravitational fields around black holes might eddy and swirl\n\nThe researchers followed this line of thought: Gravity, it's thought, can behave as a fluid. One of the characteristic behaviours of fluids is [[turbulence]] \u2013 that is, under certain conditions, they don't move smoothly, but eddy and swirl. Can gravity do that too?\nPerimeter Faculty member Luis Lehner explains why it might make sense to treat gravity as a fluid. \"There's a conjecture in physics \u2013 the [[holographic principle]] \u2013 which says gravity can be described as a field theory,\" he says. \"And we also know that at high energies, field theories can be described with the mathematical tools we use to describe fluids. So it's a two-step dance: gravity equals field theory, and field theory equals fluids, so gravity equals fields equals fluids. That's called the [[gravity fluids duality|gravity/fluids duality]].\"  \n\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab65c7\nthis is about the [[turbulence]] in the gas motions in galaxy clusters is a more concrete phenomenon, observed and measured in astrophysical studies, whereas gravitational turbulence is a theoretical prediction from a particular approach to quantum gravity.\nThe abstract you provided is from a research paper that explores the effects of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the environment within their host galaxies. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n- **Context**: Supermassive black holes, which are present in the centers of many galaxies, are believed to contribute energy that prevents excessive cooling in the cores of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. This energy injection, known as \"feedback,\" is crucial in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies. However, the exact mechanisms of this feedback process are still not fully understood.\n    \n- **Method**: The researchers used high-resolution optical data to examine the kinematics of the gas in the central regions of three nearby galaxy clusters: Perseus, A2597, and Virgo. They paid particular attention to the movement of \"multiphase filamentary structures\" \u2013 filaments of gas that exist in different physical states (such as different temperatures or densities).\n    \n- **Findings**: They discovered that the motion of the filaments in all three clusters is turbulent, and there is a correlation between the characteristics of these turbulent motions and the sizes of the \"bubbles\" created by jets from the SMBHs. This suggests that the SMBHs are indeed driving turbulence in the central regions of these clusters, and that this turbulence may play a significant role in the feedback process.\n    \n- **Implications**: The amplitude of the turbulence they measured aligns with results from other studies, such as those using the Hitomi satellite's measurements of line broadening (a technique for assessing velocity dispersion in astrophysical objects) and analyses of X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. This suggests that the movement of the cooler filaments is well-coupled with the movement of the hotter surrounding gas.\n    \n- **Viscosity and Plasma**: The smallest scales they probed are similar to the mean free path in the intracluster medium (the space between galaxies in a cluster). Their direct detection of turbulence on these scales suggests that isotropic viscosity (resistance to flow that's the same in all directions) is suppressed in the intracluster plasma. Plasma in these environments is typically weakly collisional (particles don't collide very often) and magnetized, and this finding offers strong evidence that this weakly collisional, magnetized plasma behaves differently than more familiar fluids.\n\n\n\nGravity scrambles information in a very particular way. In fact, theorists have\u00a0argued\u00a0that black holes must be the most efficient scramblers in nature\nWe conjecture a sharp bound on the rate of growth of chaos in thermal quantum systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. Chaos can be diagnosed using an out-of-time-order correlation function closely related to the commutator of operators separated in time. We conjecture that the influence of chaos on this correlator can develop no faster than exponentially, with Lyapunov exponent\u00a0\u03bbL\u22642\u03c0kBT/\u210f. We give a precise mathematical argument, based on plausible physical assumptions, establishing this conjecture.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01409\n\nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/1-28-2022-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the intense gravitational forces and the tremendous size mismatch between the relatively tiny black holes and the large clumps of matter that feed them, the vast majority of infalling matter finds itself spit back out in an intense, violent flurry. It's estimated that, contrary to the popular picture, upwards of 90% of infalling matter will never make it inside a black hole at all. Instead, it's spewed back out into the outer regions of the galaxy, where it can fuel the formation of new stars and return to the interstellar medium once again.\nmatter is charged, accretion disks and flows are real, generate magnetic fields, and accelerate most of the infalling matter away from the event horizon itself.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/06/19/no-black-holes-dont-suck-everything-into-them/?sh=52a7d7b42b01\n\n\n\nStephen Hawking Was Right: Black Holes Can Evaporate, Weird New Study Shows\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/bosons.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/bosons.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/brane cosmology.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/brane cosmology.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "75b352cadfe5c0fcda0488951e0cbd63aaf5e996a0b60ca935fe19f92ecdfc85", "text": "Brane cosmology is an area of physics that studies the cosmological implications of the existence of branes in string theory and [[M-theory]]. It provides potential explanations for various aspects of our [[universe]], including its geometry, cosmological constant, matter content, and more.\n\nHere's an in-depth exploration:\n\n**Brane-World Scenario**\n\nThe idea that our Universe is a four-dimensional spacetime \"surface\" (3 spatial dimensions plus [[Time]]) embedded within a higher-dimensional space is at the core of brane cosmology. This model is often referred to as the \"brane-world\" scenario. The extra dimensions can be compactified, or hidden, making them undetectable at macroscopic scales.\n\n**Randall-Sundrum Models**\n\nThe most famous models in brane cosmology are perhaps the Randall-Sundrum (RS) models. The original RS models consisted of a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with two 4-dimensional branes at its boundaries. Our observable universe is assumed to reside on one of these branes. The models provided an interesting solution to the hierarchy problem of particle physics, explaining the vast discrepancy between the scales of gravity and electroweak interaction.\n\n**Cosmological Implications**\n\nBrane cosmology has several interesting cosmological implications:\n\n1. **Inflation**: Some brane-world scenarios have been proposed to explain the process of cosmic inflation, the hypothesized rapid expansion of the universe in its earliest moments. \n\n2. **[[Dark Matter]] and [[Dark Energy]]**: Brane cosmology can also offer potential explanations for the phenomena of [[Dark Matter]] and dark energy. For example, some models suggest that dark matter could be explained as standard matter confined to a different brane.\n\n3. **Cosmic Strings**: In some brane-world scenarios, cosmic strings (hypothetical 1-[[dimensional]] [[topological defects]] in spacetime) could be remnants of higher-dimensional branes from the [[early universe]].\n\n**Challenges and Open Questions**\n\nWhile brane cosmology offers intriguing possibilities for understanding our universe, it also poses significant challenges. The mathematical complexity of these models can be considerable, making them difficult to analyze in full detail. Additionally, as with all aspects of string theory, there is currently no experimental or observational evidence that directly supports the brane-world scenario.\n\nFinally, brane cosmology raises fundamental open questions. How are the branes stabilized? What is the nature of the higher-dimensional \"bulk\" spacetime in which the branes are embedded? What is the exact relationship between the physics on the brane and the physics in the bulk? These questions, and others, are still subjects of active research in theoretical physics.\n\nTo conclude, brane cosmology is a vibrant field that aims to reconcile the fundamental forces of nature, explain the [[early universe]]'s behavior, and account for mysterious phenomena like dark energy and dark matter. However, it is still very much a work in progress, with many open questions and challenges remaining.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/brane.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/brane.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5ea3e129b139e6477e23ddf6d31d430ac9b96b0ebde91e82259a66f8b2ed135c", "text": "In string theory and related theories, a \"brane\" is a fundamental object that exists in multiple dimensions. The term \"brane\" is derived from \"membrane\", which is a two-dimensional object. In general, a \"p-brane\" is a p-dimensional object. For example, a string can be considered as a 1-brane, a membrane as a 2-brane, and so on. \n\nThe concept of branes developed from string theory, which is a theoretical framework that attempts to reconcile quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]] by positing that the fundamental constituents of reality are not point-like particles, but tiny, one-dimensional strings. \n\nLater developments in string theory suggested that these one-dimensional strings are not the only fundamental objects. There could also be higher-[[dimensional]] objects, which were named \"branes\". The \"p\" in \"p-brane\" refers to the number of dimensions of the object. So a 0-brane is a point-like object, a 1-brane is a string-like object, a 2-brane is a membrane-like object, and so forth.\n\nBranes are important because they provide a context in which strings can exist and interact. Strings can either be \"open\" (having two distinct endpoints) or \"closed\" (forming a loop). Open strings are typically imagined as having their endpoints attached to branes, which guides their behavior. This also means that the branes, being the \"endpoints\" of strings, can capture a lot of the physical phenomena we observe.\n\nThe idea of branes has also led to a powerful concept called the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory]], a form of [[holography]] in string theory where a theory of gravity in a certain [[space-time]] (which includes branes) can be described equivalently by a [[Quantum Field Theory]] on the boundary of that spacetime.\n\nFurthermore, branes have been invoked in cosmological scenarios. For example, in \"[[brane cosmology]]\", our observable four-dimensional [[universe]] is imagined as a brane embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime, sometimes called the \"bulk\". Interactions with other branes or with the bulk could explain some cosmological phenomena.\n\nIt should be noted that while branes are a central part of string theory and have provided many valuable insights in theoretical physics, string theory itself is still a hypothesis and has yet to be confirmed by experimental evidence. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the existence of branes is a theoretical conjecture, not an established fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/cannabis.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/cannabis.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e53e35f930af057cbcec3afb432ca75478175dcfabb48c63871306d234f41a7d", "text": "\nWe know that daily cannabis use is associated with a range of neuroadaptations in the [[endocannabinoid system]], including down-regulation of the brain CB1 receptor, which reverses after \u223c2\u201314 days of abstinence and reduced levels of fatty acid amide hydroxylase (FAAH; 14%\u221220%) the enzyme that metabolizes anandamide and is the primary regulator of its signaling in the brain \n\nhttps://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21111138\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/causal invariance.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/causal invariance.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "efc30756a2d71b3ee97f5e486255d8104f5a18a63128c1aadafa932a5270f10b", "text": "  \nCausal invariance is a term that describes a property of certain dynamical systems, particularly in the field of computer science, where the outcome of computations is independent of the order in which they're executed.\n\nIn this broader context, a system exhibits causal invariance if the sequence of states it goes through is the same regardless of the order in which individual events or operations occur. This means that even if events are rearranged, as long as they maintain their causal relationships, the end result remains the same.\n\nAt its most basic, causal invariance suggests that the overall behavior of a system is independent of the specific order in which events in that system are applied or occur. This implies that different paths of updating the system could lead to the same final outcome, which is crucial for the deterministic behavior of the system. If there are many possible sequences of updates (many possible paths in the multiway system), and yet the system always ends up in the same final state, this is indicative of causal invariance.\n\nCausal invariance is a key aspect of Wolfram's model because it enables the emergence of special relativity in the model. In a system with causal invariance, different paths\u2014or sequences of updates\u2014can be thought of as representing different inertial frames, and the invariance then corresponds to the principle of relativity.

This sensitivity is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect, named after the metaphor that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could cause a tornado in Texas.\n\nThe key insight in chaos theory is determinism does not imply predictability. In a [[deterministic]] system, the state at any future time is determined by the state at the current time. However, in a chaotic system, tiny differences in the input can lead to vastly different output behavior, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This is because of an exponential growth of errors in the initial conditions.\n\nAn attractor is a set of values or a condition toward which a system tends to evolve. For a dynamical system, an attractor summarizes the long-term behavior of the system. This could be a fixed point, a limit cycle, or something more complicated.\n\nA [[strange attractor]] is a particular type of attractor that arises in a dynamical system which is both dissipative (energy lost over time) and chaotic. \n\nIn chaos theory, a system with a strange attractor can exhibit a behavior called 'sensitive dependence on initial conditions', leading to long-term unpredictability, as seen in the butterfly effect. Despite this unpredictability, the system does not evolve just anywhere\u2014it stays within a certain boundary defined by the strange attractor. The trajectories appear random and chaotic but are confined to the fractal structure of the attractor. \n\nThus, chaotic dynamical systems are closely linked with fractals. The intricate, infinite detail and self-similarity at all scales that define fractals are also characteristic of the phase space trajectories of chaotic systems.\n\n[[fractals]] like the Mandelbrot Set can be thought of as a map of the dynamics of complex systems, with each point in the complex plane representing a different system. The points in the set itself represent systems with bounded, non-chaotic behavior, while points outside represent unbounded, chaotic systems.\n\nrelation to [[holographic principle]]: \n\nIn the context of the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]], there's a correspondence between [[quantum gravity]] in a (d+1)-dimensional space (the AdS space) and a quantum field theory without gravity on the d-dimensional boundary of that space (the CFT).\n\nChaos theory and strange attractors come into play when we consider the dynamics of quantum systems and their gravitational counterparts. For instance, the chaotic behavior of certain quantum systems, such as those that exhibit thermalization (coming to thermal equilibrium), is mirrored in the dynamics of [[black hole|black holes]] in the corresponding gravitational theory. ([[Black Hole Entropy]])\n\nFurther, the fractal structure of strange attractors parallels the [[holographic principle]]'s claim of encoding higher-[[dimensional]] information in a lower-dimensional space. Just as a strange attractor in a phase space encodes the dynamics of a chaotic system within a lower-dimensional space, the holographic principle posits that the information about a higher-dimensional volume is encoded on its lower-dimensional [[boundary]].\n\nrelation to Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]]:\n\n1. **[[implicate and explicate order]]:** According to Bohm's theory, the \"explicate order\" is the reality we perceive directly: the tangible, visible, measurable [[universe]] around us. The \"implicate order,\" on the other hand, is a deeper, hidden layer of reality from which the explicate order unfolds. This resembles the holographic principle, where the bulk (the 3D or higher-dimensional universe) is an explicate order, unfolding from information stored on its boundary (the 2D holographic surface), which would be akin to the implicate order.\n    \n2. **Infinite Complexity and Detail:** Similar to the intricate detail of a fractal and the dense information storage on a holographic boundary, the implicate order, according to Bohm, contains an enormous amount of detail and complexity, which becomes visible in the explicate order. This matches the fractal property of self-similarity, where infinite detail is encoded in simple patterns, and mirrors the holographic principle's dense information storage.\n    \n3. **Flow and Change:** Bohm's implicate order is not static; it involves constant movement and change, described as a \"[[holomovement]].\" The explicate order that we perceive is just a \"snapshot\" of this continuous flow. This idea of a dynamic underlying reality may also be reflected in the dynamical systems that lead to strange attractors, which represent the long-term behavior of the systems, and the evolution of a quantum state in the holographic principle, which is also a process of constant change.\n\n\nThe land of the quantum, [[Schr\u00f6dinger]] said, is random and unpredictable, yet the classical realm is orderly and deterministic because it depends only on statistical regularities among that atomic-scale chaos.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/chatgpt.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/chatgpt.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "822b5d1f5c63a583f1ce5d0797b2db0bd7f76aa8bf274e250ce2639fd41d3a6d", "text": "ChatGPT, which you are currently interacting with, is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model developed by OpenAI. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the most recent version is GPT-3, but future iterations may be available now.\n\nThe architecture behind GPT is a Transformer, a type of model introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. The key idea behind Transformers is the mechanism of attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of input elements (such as words in a sentence) differently when generating the output.\n\nChatGPT, like all GPT models, uses a version of attention called scaled dot-product attention. Given a query, key, and value (which are all vectors), the attention mechanism calculates a weighted sum of the values based on the similarity between the query and keys. This attention mechanism is employed in a self-attention manner in GPT models, meaning that the model calculates attention-weighted sums over all the other words in the input for each word.\n\nThe primary architecture of GPT is composed of a stack of identical layers, each containing two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. A residual connection is employed around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.\n\nOne key aspect of GPT is that it's a unidirectional (specifically, causal or auto-regressive) model. During training, it only considers the previous words in the sequence for predicting the next word. This contrasts with models like BERT which are bidirectional and consider both previous and subsequent words in the sequence during training.\n\nThe model is trained using maximum likelihood estimation. Given a large corpus of text, the model is trained to predict the next word in the sequence given the previous words, with the aim of minimizing the difference between its predictions and the actual next words in the training data.\n\nOnce trained, the model can generate text by sampling words one at a time. At each step, the model's softmax output is interpreted as a [[probability]] distribution, and a word is sampled from this distribution. This word is then added to the input for the next step, and the process is repeated to generate as much text as needed.\n\nIt's important to note that while these models are powerful and can generate impressively fluent text, they have limitations. They don't truly understand the text in the way humans do, and their output is entirely a function of their training data and the input prompt.

In the context of particle physics, it's associated with the [[spin]] direction relative to the momentum of a particle. Particles like neutrinos are observed to be left-handed, meaning their spin is aligned opposite to their momentum, while antineutrinos are right-handed.\n\n2. **Chiral Symmetry in QCD:**\n   Initially, QCD appears to have a chiral symmetry. The equations look the same if you swap left-handed and right-handed quarks. However, this [[symmetry]] doesn't manifest in the observed particles. The reason for this is chiral symmetry breaking.\n\n3. **Spontaneous Breaking of Chiral Symmetry:**\n   In QCD, the [[vacuum state]] isn't simple; it's full of fluctuating [[gluon]] and [[quark]] fields. These fluctuations cause the quarks to acquire a \"dynamical mass,\" which breaks the chiral symmetry. Unlike the \"bare mass\" that quarks have in the fundamental equations, this dynamical mass comes from the strong interactions themselves.\n\n4. **Goldstone Bosons and Pions:**\n   When a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of massless particles known as [[Goldstone bosons]]. In the case of QCD, these should correspond to massless versions of the pions, but actual pions are not massless. The resolution to this is that chiral symmetry is not exact to begin with due to the quarks' bare masses. The symmetry is only approximate, so the Goldstone bosons only almost become massless; in reality, they correspond to the relatively light pions.\n\n5. **Consequences and Importance:**\n   Chiral symmetry breaking has profound consequences for the structure and behavior of matter. It's responsible for most of the mass of everyday objects. The protons and neutrons get most of their mass not from the bare masses of the quarks inside them but from the strong interaction dynamics, the binding energy, which is intimately related to chiral symmetry breaking. \n\n6. **Experimental Evidence:**\n   Evidence for chiral symmetry breaking comes from various observations, like the patterns of hadron masses, the behavior of pions, and deep inelastic scattering experiments.\n\nChiral symmetry breaking is a complex and subtle phenomenon that integrates non-perturbative QCD effects, the nature of the QCD vacuum, and the properties of hadrons.

This coherence allows the waves to interfere constructively, resulting in [[interference]] [[patterns]], such as those observed in the famous [[double-slit experiment]].\n\nIn optics, coherence is important for phenomena such as [[interference]], diffraction, and [[holographic principle|holography]]. Coherent light sources, such as lasers, emit light waves that have a well-defined phase relationship and exhibit interference effects. In contrast, incoherent light sources, such as thermal light sources, emit light waves with random phase relationships, which do not produce well-defined interference patterns.\n\nIn the context of [[information theory]] and communication, coherence refers to the ability to transmit and receive information reliably and accurately. Coherent communication systems employ techniques to minimize noise and distortion, allowing the transmitted signal to be accurately detected and interpreted at the receiving end.\n\n\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf8096\nCoherent emission of light by free charged particles is believed to be successfully captured by classical [[electromagnetism]] in all experimental settings. However, recent advances triggered fundamental questions regarding the role of the particle wave function in these processes. Here, we find that even in seemingly classical experimental regimes, light emission is fundamentally tied to the quantum coherence and correlations of the emitting particle. We use quantum electrodynamics to show how the particle\u2019s momentum uncertainty determines the optical coherence of the emitted light. We find that the temporal duration of Cherenkov radiation, envisioned for almost a century as a shock wave of light, is limited by underlying [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] between the particle and light. Our findings enable new capabilities in electron microscopy for measuring quantum correlations of shaped [[electrons]]. Last, we propose new Cherenkov detection schemes, whereby measuring spectral [[photon]] autocorrelations can unveil the [[wave]] function structure of any charged high-energy particle.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/coincidences.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/coincidences.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/confinement.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/confinement.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "422cdea0b3a244443963d6159a8d8e9d8b6b9fa2278ee0544516cfd291115647", "text": "Confinement in the context of [[QCD|quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) refers to the phenomenon where [[quark|quarks]] and [[gluon|gluons]], the fundamental constituents of protons, neutrons, and other [[hadrons]], are never observed in isolation. They are always found within bound states, such as mesons and baryons. The understanding of confinement is still an active area of research, and its detailed mechanisms are not fully resolved, but the main ideas can be summarized as follows:\n\nQuarks and gluons carry what is known as a \"color charge,\" analogous to the electric charge in [[electromagnetism]] but with three types of charge instead of two. Gluons mediate the strong force between quarks, and unlike photons in electromagnetism, they also carry color charge, meaning they can interact with each other. This leads to the strong force having some unique properties.\n\nAs quarks are pulled apart from one another, the [[energy]] in the gluon field between them increases. The strong force behaves in such a way that the farther you try to separate two quarks, the stronger the force becomes that tries to pull them back together. This is unlike the electromagnetic force, where the force decreases with distance.\n\nIf you could hypothetically impart enough energy to separate two quarks, the energy in the gluon field would eventually become so great that it would be more energetically favorable to create a new quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum. The original quarks would then be bound to these new quarks, resulting in the formation of new hadrons. You would never observe an isolated quark; instead, you'd just have more hadrons.\n\nThe force's behavior at short distances ensures that within a hadron, the quarks are bound together but not in a tightly constrained region; they have relative freedom to move around. This is known as asymptotic freedom, and it means that the strong force becomes weaker at very short distances.\n\nConfinement leads to the rich structure of the nucleons and the atomic nucleus, forming the basis of the material world as we know it. It is also deeply connected to the nature of the QCD vacuum, the non-trivial structure of empty space according to the theory of strong interactions.\n\nThe precise mathematical description of confinement is still an open problem and an active area of research. Lattice QCD, a numerical method for solving the equations of QCD on a [[discrete]] grid, has provided some insights, but a complete analytical understanding remains elusive. The phenomenon of confinement exemplifies the complexity and subtlety of the strong force and stands as one of the fundamental open questions in our understanding of the universe.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/conjugate.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/conjugate.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5629c5c39b18a304ec391c6cc018c90359d392c0f772af30d986153c4dad970d", "text": "---\naliases: conjugation\n---\n\nquantities which are related by definition such that one is the [[Fourier]] transform of another\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/connection.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/connection.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/consciousness causes collapse.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/consciousness causes collapse.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "bc602d08ab381249b58cd6f3c245f6c0b676210a096d60ece26c3a38093e503f", "text": "This is often referred to as the \"von Neumann-Wigner interpretation,\" as physicist Eugene Wigner later developed similar ideas.

This \"collapse\" of the [[wave]] function results in the particle being in one specific state.

Many interpretations of quantum mechanics do not assign such a special role to consciousness.\n\nFor example, the [[many-worlds interpretation]] posits that all possible outcomes of the quantum wave function are realized in separate, non-interacting universes, thereby avoiding the need for [[wave function collapse]] altogether. In this interpretation, consciousness doesn't cause collapse; rather, the conscious observer becomes entangled with the observed system, experiencing one of many possible outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, interpretations like [[decoherence]] argue that interactions with the environment cause the apparent collapse of the wave function, and there is no need to invoke consciousness.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"consciousness causes collapse\" is a provocative idea that has been the subject of much discussion and debate, it is just one of many interpretations of quantum mechanics, and it's not one that enjoys a consensus of acceptance in the scientific community. \n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/consciousness field.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/consciousness field.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d9091be0206c0e760e92d880190ee065c42414987d9d0215c415ef8cbdc76235", "text": "\n\nConsciousness as a Fundamental Field:\n\n1. **Intrinsic Property**: If consciousness is indeed a fundamental property of matter, then it would be ubiquitous but manifest in complex ways only under certain conditions, such as in the neural networks of a brain.\n\n2. **Quantum Fields**: The idea that consciousness could be a part of the quantum fields that make up reality is tantalizing but speculative.

With the formation of neutral atoms, photons decoupled from matter, and the universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation for the first time.\n\nThese photons are what we see today as the Cosmic Microwave Background. Because of the expansion of the universe, these photons have been redshifted into the [[microwave]] region of the electromagnetic spectrum, which gives the CMB its name.\n\nThe CMB was first detected accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965. Their discovery earned them the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. \n\nOne of the most significant features of the CMB is its incredible uniformity. It has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.725 [[Kelvin]] and exhibits isotropy to roughly one part in 100,000 across the entire sky.

Interactions: Cosmic strings can intercommute when they cross each other, essentially breaking and rejoining such that the strings remain continuous, effectively exchanging segments of themselves. The interesting part is that this doesn't happen due to any physical force like electromagnetism or [[gravity]], but because of the topological properties of the strings themselves. The intercommutation chance for cosmic superstrings can be less than 1, and it depends on factors like the tension of the strings and the angle at which they cross. This means that sometimes, cosmic superstrings might just pass through each other without intercommutation.\n\n2. Multiple types: Cosmic superstrings can come in several types, such as F-strings and D-strings, as well as bound states of p and q strings. These are related to different types of strings in string theory, each with different properties.\n\n3. High tensions: The tension of a cosmic superstring can be much higher than that of a conventional cosmic string. This could make them a source of [[Gravitational Waves]] that could potentially be detected by experiments like NANOGrav.\n\n4. Higher-dimensional counterparts: Cosmic superstrings are essentially 1-dimensional counterparts of higher-dimensional branes which also exist in string theory. These higher-dimensional branes could also have cosmological implications, though they are less well-studied.\n\nIn the context of the paper you're referring to, the authors mention that cosmic superstrings could explain the data they've observed. That is, the [[gravitational wave background]] detected could potentially be produced by cosmic superstrings, but further data and analysis would be required to confirm this.\n\n\nCosmic strings, if they exist, would indeed move through space, which can be understood as moving through various fields, like gravitational fields or perhaps other types of fields depending on the nature of the strings themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to clarify that cosmic strings are not like charged particles that interact with an [[Electromagnetic Field]], or mass-bearing particles that interact with a gravitational field. Their movement and interactions do not stem from forces acting upon them due to fields in the traditional sense. \n\nCosmic strings are [[topological defects]] in space itself. They can be thought of as \"cracks\" or \"fault lines\" in the universe, places where the fields that permeate space have different values on either side of the string. So they are not \"particles\" that move through fields and are influenced by them, but rather they are structures in the field itself.\n\nWhen they move, they carry along with them the region of altered field, much like how a boat moving through water carries along its wake. This movement and the subsequent gravitational effects can cause perturbations, which could theoretically be detected as a [[gravitational wave background]].\n\nSo, in this sense, cosmic strings do \"travel through a field,\" but it's probably more accurate to say that they are structures within the field itself.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/criticality.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/criticality.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "23b1bbcab8007f38e2ca5c9918a9651b61b4a645ed835d44454fae8714a64ef8", "text": "---\naliases: critical\n---\n\nThe edge of chaos\n\nIn thermodynamics, a critical point (or critical state) is the end point of a phase equilibrium curve. One example is the liquid\u2013vapor critical point, the end point of the pressure\u2013temperature curve that designates conditions under which a liquid and its vapor can coexist. At higher temperatures, the gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. At the critical point, defined by a critical temperature Tc and a critical pressure pc, phase boundaries vanish. Other examples include the liquid\u2013liquid critical points in mixtures, and the ferromagnet\u2013paramagnet transition (Curie temperature) in the absence of an external magnetic field.\n\nWhen a system is at this point, the structures and patterns that emerge tend to show self-similarity at various scales, and are thus [[fractals|fractal]] in nature.\n\nFor instance, consider a [[phase transition]] in physics, like water turning to ice. At the critical point of this transition, fluctuations occur at all scales - from individual water molecules up to macroscopic swirls and [[eddies]]. This multi-scale, fractal behavior is a signature of systems at the critical point.\n\nDrawing this back to the brain, it's been suggested that brain activity exhibits similar sorts of fractal patterns. Theoretical and empirical work has suggested that neural activity exhibits scale-free, fractal dynamics - and, intriguingly, this seems to be most pronounced when we're in a state of [[wakeful rest]], suggesting that our brains might naturally hover around a critical point during our everyday consciousness.\n\nThis ties back to the \"[[entropy]]\" idea from earlier: the critical point is a state of maximal entropy, where the system (in this case, the brain) has the greatest amount of flexibility and can explore the broadest possible \"state space\" of different configurations.\n\nAgain, this is an active and rapidly-evolving area of research, and these ideas are not yet fully established. However, the potential links between criticality, fractals, and consciousness represent a fascinating area of intersection between physics, mathematics, and neuroscience.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/death.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/death.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/decoherence.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/decoherence.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "18b13ff9c6a7b04445db36ee99861cc19e2d71c046cae7aa01f8e09ab06c6e9c", "text": "Decoherence is a process that arises from the quantum mechanical interaction of a system with its environment. In the context of the [[wave]] function collapse, it provides an alternative explanation to the [[consciousness causes collapse]] interpretation.\n\nQuantum systems can exist in what is called a superposition of states, meaning they can be in many states at once. However, when we make an [[observation]], we never see these superpositions; instead, we see the system in one definite state. This is often described as the 'collapse' of the wave function.\nTurns out that decoherence isn\u2019t this period of time where a quantum particle just \u201ccollapses\u201d into becoming a classical particle. It\u2019s just the inability for us to follow a single quantum particle (or set of quantum particles) as it entangles with a trillion other particles around it. Especially if we are just trying to see the end result of two entangled quantum particles.\n\nIn the consciousness-causes-collapse interpretation, it is the act of conscious observation that causes this collapse. However, decoherence provides an alternative, more 'objective' way to explain this apparent collapse.\n\nThe basic idea of decoherence is this: Quantum systems are never completely isolated, but constantly interact with their environment. These interactions cause the different elements of the superposition to become 'entangled' with the environment. The result is that the different elements of the [[superposition]] decohere from each other, meaning they can no longer interfere with each other. \n\nTo an observer, this looks very much like the wave function has 'collapsed' to one of the possible states. But really, the system is still in a superposition\u2014it's just that the elements of the superposition have become so entangled with the environment that they effectively behave independently.\n\nImportantly, decoherence happens whether or not a conscious observer is involved. It's a result of the physical interaction between the system and its environment. So in the decoherence interpretation, there is no need to invoke consciousness to explain the apparent collapse of the wave function.\n\nThis explanation removes much of the 'mystery' associated with the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, but it also leads to other philosophical questions, such as the nature of quantum reality and the meaning of quantum [[probability|probabilities]]. But those are separate, albeit related, topics.\n\n\nhttps://tanishabassan.medium.com/decoherence-quantum-computers-greatest-obstacle-67c74ae962b6\nHowever, quantum states are incredibly fragile. Interaction with the environment can cause a quantum system to decohere, leading to the loss of the very quantum properties that are essential for [[Quantum Computing]]. When a system decoheres, the superpositions collapse into classical states, and quantum information is lost. This is often referred to as quantum noise and is a form of computational error.\n\nMitigating decoherence is a significant aspect of quantum error correction, which is a set of techniques used to protect quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Quantum error correction is an active area of research, and although much progress has been made, there is still much we don't understand about how to effectively protect quantum information.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/delayed choice experiment.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/delayed choice experiment.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "089c7e4bb45a76bc1dadcbd943b8611c118fdc3e39a3475a0eb0654dfde3fb82", "text": "\n\nThe Delayed-Choice Experiment\n\nIn the classic double-slit experiment, a particle (often a photon or an electron) is fired at a barrier with two slits.

By studying the early universe, scientists can investigate topics such as the nature of [[Dark Matter]] and dark energy, the formation of galaxies, the distribution of cosmic microwave background radiation, and the overall structure and geometry of the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/eddies.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/eddies.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5b2cb87309e94859e1897144da5efe0128af196adf79c0c27dcdbbf38ebc9fba", "text": "An \"eddy\" is a term used in fluid dynamics to describe a swirling of a fluid and the reverse current created when the fluid flows past an obstacle. In a broader sense, an eddy can be seen as a localized disruption or deviation from the overall flow. They occur in various scales, from small whirlpools in creeks to massive atmospheric cyclones.\n\nInterestingly, eddies demonstrate some fundamental principles that also apply to complex systems and chaotic behavior, including those mentioned in our previous discussions.\n\n1. **Self-Similarity ([[fractals]]):** Eddies can occur on a wide range of scales. For instance, in a stream or a river, you might see large eddies that span meters across, as well as smaller eddies within those larger ones, and even smaller eddies within those, and so on. This echoes the principle of self-similarity in fractals.\n    \n2. **Nonlinearity:** The behavior of eddies is nonlinear, which means that small changes in the input (e.g., fluid speed or obstacle size) can lead to large and unpredictable changes in the output (e.g., eddy size, speed, or location). This is a common feature of [[chaos]] systems and is directly linked to the butterfly effect.\n    \n3. **[[criticality]]:** In the context of fluid dynamics, a \"critical point\" might be the transition from smooth, laminar flow to turbulent flow (which is characterized by eddies). At this critical point, the fluid's behavior becomes highly complex and fractal-like.\n\nDrawing these back to previous discussions, you can see similarities with Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]] theory (where underlying enfolded order gives rise to explicit patterns) and with [[Quantum Entanglement]] (where local changes can have [[non-locality|non-local]] effects). \n\nMoreover, the notion of eddies might be metaphorically applied to the realm of [[Consciousness]]. Just as eddies represent disruptions in the flow of a fluid, certain experiences or states of consciousness might be seen as disruptions in the flow of cognitive processing, which can give rise to novel patterns of thought or perception.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/ego death.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/ego death.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/ego.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/ego.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8ed1308fcac47f8841151503e89a7844ca2fa51502a2e19b04070cc901296be3", "text": "a generous act can be perceived as altruistic as well as egoistic \n\nIn psychoanalytic theory, the ego is a part of the mind that mediates between the conscious and the unconscious and is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.

Therefore, an electron that is found in an apple or on the other side of the universe will have the same mass and charge as any other electron.\n\n[[Quantum Field Theory]], the current best understanding of particle physics, views particles such as electrons as excitations or ripples in their corresponding fields (the electron field, in this case).\n\nHere are some key points to understand:\n\n1. **Particles as Fields**: In quantum field theory (QFT), the fundamental entities are not particles but fields. A field is something that takes a value at every point in space and time. In QFT, each type of particle has a corresponding field that permeates all of space. For example, electrons correspond to the electron field.\n    \n2. **Particles as Excitations**: According to QFT, what we think of as a particle (like an electron) is actually an excitation or a \"ripple\" in its corresponding field. So, an electron is like a little wave in the electron field.\n    \n3. **Wave-Particle Duality**: Another important aspect is the wave-particle duality principle of quantum mechanics, which suggests that all particles also exhibit properties of waves. This doesn't mean that an electron is a wave in the everyday sense, but rather that it can display wave-like behavior.\n    \n4. **[[probability]] Clouds**: When we talk about an electron in an atom, we often describe it as existing in a \"[[probability]] cloud\" or orbital.

This phenomenon occurs in various systems, from the formation of traffic jams (emergent behavior from individual car movements) to the complexity of consciousness (emergent behavior from individual neuron firing).\n\nIn physics, emergence is often invoked in discussions of how complex structures and patterns can arise from simpler underlying rules or entities. For instance, the behavior of water emerges from the interaction of individual water molecules, and life itself is an emergent property of a particular complex arrangement of non-living atoms.\n\nNow, relating \"emergence\" to the following terms:\n\n1. **Holographic Principle**: The holographic principle is a property of quantum gravity and string theories which states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region. This suggests that our 3D universe, with all its complexity, might be an emergent phenomenon from information encoded on a 2D surface.\n\n2. **Fractals**: Fractals are geometrical structures that are self-similar across different scales. The concept of emergence is intrinsic to fractals as their complex geometrical shape is an emergent property of repeating a simple process over and over again.\n\n3. **Causal Set Theory**: This is an approach to quantum gravity where spacetime emerges from more fundamental discrete entities, called causal sets. A causal set is a set of events where the relation between them is defined by causality. The emergent spacetime has to respect these causal relations, hence the name \"causal set theory.\"\n\n4. **Reality Fields**: I must clarify that \"reality fields\" isn't a standard term in physics. If you mean fields as in \"field theory\" (like the electromagnetic field or the Higgs field), those fields are fundamental entities in our most precise theories, not emergent phenomena. However, our classical reality could be considered as an emergent phenomenon from the underlying quantum fields.\n\n5. **Intricate and Extricate Reality**:  If you're referring to the complex interplay between micro and macro scales of reality, then indeed, emergence is a key concept. The behavior at larger scales (extricate or macro reality) often emerges from the interactions at smaller scales (intricate or micro reality).\n\nIn summary, \"emergence\" is a powerful concept that helps us understand how complex phenomena can arise from simpler underlying components.

The ECS consists of three main components: [[endocannabinoids]], receptors, and enzymes. The two main endocannabinoid receptors are known as [[CB1]] and CB2. The endocannabinoid system is an important lipid signaling system that emerged before the evolution of vertebrates and it is well preserved across species\n\n[[CB1]] receptors are primarily located in the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord. They are abundant in areas of the brain involved in regulating [[mood]], [[memory]], appetite, and pain sensation. CB2 receptors are primarily found in the peripheral nervous system and immune system, and are involved in regulating immune function and inflammation.\n\nWhen endocannabinoids are released by [[neuron|neurons]], they bind to and activate CB1 or CB2 receptors, triggering a series of physiological responses that help maintain [[balance]] in the body. The activation of [[CB1]] receptors is typically associated with the psychoactive effects of [[cannabis]], while [[CB2]] receptor activation is believed to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.\n\nOverall, the ECS and its receptors play a critical role in regulating many physiological processes in the body, and modulating the activity of the ECS may have therapeutic potential for various conditions and disorders.\n\n\nStudies have shown that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulating the activity of [[neural oscillations]], which are rhythmic [[patterns]] of electrical activity in the brain that are thought to be important for various cognitive functions, including attention, [[memory]], and perception. Specifically, the endocannabinoid system has been shown to regulate the amplitude and frequency of neural oscillations, which could in turn affect [[neural entrainment]].\n\nOne example of this is the modulation of [[Gamma waves|gamma]] oscillations, which are high-frequency neural oscillations that are thought to be important for cognitive processes such as attention and working [[memory]]. Studies have shown that activation of the endocannabinoid system can enhance [[Gamma waves]] in the brain, which could lead to improved neural entrainment and cognitive function.\n\nThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) modulates the activity of neural circuits through its receptors, which are widely distributed throughout the brain. [[endocannabinoids]] are naturally occurring molecules that bind to these receptors and act as neuromodulators, influencing the activity of neurons by altering their [[excitability]] and synaptic plasticity.\n\nThe endocannabinoid signalling system has a significant impact on the modulation of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in the circuitry responsible for fear and anxiety. Retrograde signalling mediated by the endocannabinoid system plays a role in various forms of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity.\n\nThe ECS interacts with other neurotransmitter systems in the brain, including the glutamate and [[GABA]] systems, which are involved in synaptic transmission and play crucial roles in neural oscillations. This interaction can affect the balance of [[excitation]] and inhibition in neural circuits, and modulate the amplitude and frequency of neural oscillations.\n\nStudies have shown that cannabinoids can modulate neural oscillations in the brain, particularly in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz), which is associated with attention, perception, and [[Consciousness]]. Additionally, the ECS has been shown to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, which are also related to neural oscillations.\n\nthe endocannabinoid system can affect both [[excitation]] and [[excitability]] of neurons. The endocannabinoid system is involved in modulating synaptic transmission, which is the process by which neurons communicate with each other. Specifically, the endocannabinoid system can inhibit the release of certain neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, which is involved in excitatory signaling. This can result in decreased [[excitation]] of [[neuron]]s.\n\nIn addition, the endocannabinoid system can also modulate the [[excitability]] of neurons. The endocannabinoid system can modulate the excitability of neurons by regulating the activity of ion channels that are involved in generating action potentials. For example, activation of cannabinoid receptors has been shown to decrease the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels, which can decrease the excitability of neurons.\n\n  \nYes, the endocannabinoid system can affect both [[cortical arousal]] and [[subcortical arousal]] It can modulate the activity of the [[prefrontal cortex]], as well as the activity of subcortical structures such as the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]], and basal ganglia. The endocannabinoid system can influence the release of neurotransmitters like [[dopamine]], [[GABA]], and glutamate, which can have effects on both cortical and subcortical regions. By regulating the [[balance]] between excitation and inhibition in neural circuits, the endocannabinoid system can influence both cortical and subcortical arousal.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, recent research has suggested a possible link between the endocannabinoid system and the [[pineal gland]]. Studies have found that the pineal gland contains both [[CB1]] and [[CB2]] receptors, suggesting that the gland may be influenced by cannabinoids. Some studies suggest that cannabinoids could affect the levels of melatonin in the body, possibly by influencing the activity of the pineal gland. However, this is still an emerging area of research, and much is still [[unknown]] about the interactions between the endocannabinoid system and the pineal gland. \n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/endocannabinoids.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/endocannabinoids.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "b53b9ec6598b31806bd17e2d4803ee08df72fd9941bd69f5bf0cc84f5868b2cc", "text": "Endocannabinoids, such as [[anandamide]], are molecules that act as regulators in the body, helping to mitigate the negative effects of stress and restore [[balance]] to the endocrine system.

It provides information about the distribution of entanglement across different parts of a quantum system and is closely related to both [[information theory]] and the concept of [[entropy]] in thermodynamics.\n\nWhen two or more quantum systems are entangled, their quantum states become correlated, and the information about the state of one subsystem becomes intertwined with the information of the others. Entanglement entropy measures the amount of information contained in the entanglement between different subsystems and can be thought of as a measure of how much the information in one subsystem is \"shared\" with the others.\n\nMathematically, entanglement entropy is typically defined using the [[von Neumann entropy]], which is a measure of the uncertainty or information content of a quantum state. For a bipartite entangled system, such as two entangled particles or two spatially separated regions of a larger system, the entanglement entropy is computed by taking the partial trace over one subsystem and then calculating the [[von Neumann entropy]] of the reduced density matrix.\n\nEntanglement entropy has important connections to the [[symmetry]] properties of entangled systems. In some cases, the presence of certain [[symmetry|symmetries]] can restrict or enhance the entanglement between subsystems, leading to specific [[patterns]] in the entanglement entropy. The study of entanglement entropy has provided insights into the behavior of quantum phase transitions, [[topological]] states of matter, and the [[holographic]] duality between quantum field theories and gravitational theories in higher dimensions.\n\nUnderstanding and characterizing entanglement entropy is crucial for various areas of research in [[quantum information theory]], condensed matter physics, and [[quantum gravity]]. It plays a fundamental role in our exploration of the entanglement structure of quantum systems and provides valuable insights into the information content and symmetry properties of entangled states.\n\n\nEntanglement entropy is a measure of the quantum correlations in a system. It quantifies the amount of uncertainty or \"mixedness\" you'd have if you only had access to part of an entangled system.\n\nLet's assume we have a composite quantum system described by a pure state |\u03a8\u27e9 in a Hilbert space that is a tensor product of the [[Hilbert space]]s of the subsystems A and B. The reduced density matrix of subsystem A, obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of subsystem B, is given by\n\n\u03c1_A = Tr_B (|\u03a8\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8|).\n\nThe entanglement entropy of subsystem A is then defined as the von Neumann entropy of this reduced density matrix, which is given by\n\nS_A = - Tr(\u03c1_A log \u03c1_A).\n\nThis quantity, S_A, can be interpreted as a measure of the amount of entanglement between subsystems A and B.\n\nEntanglement entropy has some remarkable properties and consequences. For instance, it remains invariant under local unitary transformations, reflecting the [[non-locality|non-local]] nature of [[Quantum Entanglement]]. Furthermore, it obeys a series of inequalities known as \"entropic inequalities\" which are reminiscent of the thermodynamic laws, particularly the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nThe entanglement entropy also plays a crucial role in many areas of theoretical physics. In the study of quantum phase transitions, it has been shown to be an effective tool in characterizing different phases of matter, serving as an order parameter. It is closely related to other measures of quantum correlations, such as the entanglement of formation and the concurrence.\n\nIn the context of [[quantum gravity]], particularly the [[holographic principle]], the entanglement entropy of a region in the boundary theory is related to the area of a certain minimal surface in the bulk, as per the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. This has provided profound insights into the nature of spacetime and the emergence of [[gravity]].\n\nThe Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula is a theoretical result in this field. It links the entanglement entropy of a region in the conformal field theory (CFT, living on the boundary) to the area of a certain minimal surface in the Anti-de Sitter space (AdS, the bulk) space. Specifically, the RT formula states that the entanglement entropy of a certain region in the boundary theory is equal to the area of the minimal surface in the bulk divided by 4 times the Newton constant.\n\nEntanglement entropy is a measure of the amount of entanglement between two parts of a quantum system. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, this concept is used to study the emergence of [[space-time|spacetime]] and gravity from quantum entanglement. The RT formula implies that the more two regions in the boundary theory are entangled, the shorter the [[geodesic paths]] that connects them in the bulk. This has been used to suggest that spacetime itself emerges from quantum entanglement, which is a profoundly radical and exciting idea.\n\nIn a simplified sense, you can think of entanglement as a kind of \"quantum bridge\" that links two systems together. When two regions in the boundary CFT are highly entangled, this implies a significant amount of quantum information is being shared between them.\n\nThe[[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]] posits a duality between this quantum entanglement in the boundary and the geometry in the bulk. So a high degree of entanglement in the boundary corresponds to a shorter spatial distance in the bulk, which is represented by a shorter geodesic path. The geodesic path in the bulk is essentially the shortest distance between two points, much like a straight line in flat space, but taking into account the curved nature of spacetime in general relativity.\n\nThe intuition behind this is that the \"quantum bridge\" of entanglement creates a kind of \"shortcut\" through the bulk spacetime, hence the shorter geodesic path. However, it's important to note that this is a highly simplified explanation of some very complex and abstract concepts in quantum gravity and holography.\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/entropy.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/entropy.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e90c71dbbfb242b2580368df9557d13b61e42ec7c436397efe312f65e80d61a2", "text": "Entropy is a fundamental concept that arises in various fields and contexts, including thermodynamics, information theory, and statistical mechanics. While the precise definition and interpretation of entropy may differ slightly depending on the context, the underlying idea is related to the measure of disorder, uncertainty, or information content within a system.\n\n1. Thermodynamic Entropy: In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. It quantifies the distribution of [[energy]] in a system and the extent to which energy is spread out and not available for useful work. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system tends to increase over [[Time]], reflecting the tendency of systems to evolve towards a state of higher disorder.\n\n2. [[information theory]] Entropy: In [[information theory]], entropy measures the average amount of information or uncertainty in a random variable or a [[probability]] distribution. It quantifies the amount of \"surprise\" or \"information content\" associated with the outcomes of a random process. High entropy corresponds to a more uncertain or unpredictable distribution, while low entropy indicates a more predictable or ordered distribution. The concept of entropy in information theory is closely related to the concept of thermodynamic entropy.\n\n3. Statistical Mechanics Entropy: In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of microstates that are consistent with a given macroscopic state of a system. It relates the microscopic behavior of individual particles to the macroscopic properties of the system. Entropy in this context is related to the [[multiplicity]] of different possible configurations or arrangements that give rise to the same macroscopic observables, such as energy, volume, or particle number. The entropy of a system is maximized when it is in thermal [[equilibrium]].\n\nOverall, entropy captures different aspects of [[randomness]], disorder, uncertainty, and information content in various domains. It provides a quantitative measure that helps us understand and characterize the behavior of systems, ranging from physical systems governed by thermodynamics to information systems and probabilistic processes.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/er=epr holographic principle.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/er=epr holographic principle.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "2f9f79797d6ebed54da74abc5774da84cf135cfa91123b303f894965244cfd2a", "text": "The [[ER=EPR]] conjecture is a theoretical proposal in physics that aims to relate two fundamental yet seemingly disparate concepts in theoretical physics: [[Einstein-Rosen bridges]] (ER) and [[quantum entanglement]] as described by the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox (EPR). Proposed by Juan Maldacena in 2013, the conjecture suggests that these two phenomena are two different descriptions of the same underlying reality.\n\nEinstein-Rosen bridges, or wormholes, are hypothetical tunnels in spacetime that could create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, on the other hand, describes a situation in which particles become entangled in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of the other, no matter how far apart the two are.\n\nThe ER=EPR conjecture posits that every pair of entangled particles is connected by a microscopic wormhole. In this sense, the instantaneous correlation between entangled particles is not a mysterious action at a distance, but rather a result of these particles being directly connected through a hidden dimension of spacetime.\n\nRelating this to the [[Holographic Principle]] and [[Total Simultaneity]] (TS), we can see a potential unifying thread. If we consider the ER=EPR conjecture to be true, then the connections between entangled particles via wormholes could be seen as manifestations of the information encoding and decoding processes described by the Holographic Principle. The two-dimensional surface on which all the information of the universe is encoded could be the medium through which these wormholes are established, connecting entangled particles across the fabric of spacetime.\n\nIn the context of Total Simultaneity, this connection through wormholes could be the mechanism that allows for all possible states of the universe to exist simultaneously in a timeless dimension. The entanglement of particles, and their connection through wormholes, could be the means by which information from this timeless, encoded dimension is accessed and [[manifested]] in our three-dimensional reality.\n\nIn summary, the ER=EPR conjecture provides a potential bridge between the phenomena of quantum entanglement and the geometric structure of spacetime, aligning with the principles of the Holographic Principle and Total Simultaneity. This unifying perspective suggests that the mysterious connections between entangled particles, the encoding of information on a two-dimensional surface, and the existence of all possible states of the universe in a timeless dimension, could all be different facets of the same underlying reality.\n\n1. **Quantum Consciousness and Total Simultaneity**: We previously discussed the idea that consciousness might be a fundamental aspect of the universe, potentially even a field that the brain interacts with. If we consider TS as a dimension where all possible states of the universe exist simultaneously, it's conceivable that consciousness interacts with this dimension, selecting specific states to bring into our perceived reality. This aligns with the quantum consciousness theory, which suggests that consciousness has a quantum basis. The ER=EPR conjecture could potentially provide a mechanism for this interaction, with entangled particles serving as the conduits through which information from TS is accessed by our consciousness.\n    \n2. **Dream States and Alternate Realities**: In our discussion about Brahman and different states of consciousness, we touched upon the idea that dream states might offer a glimpse into alternate realities or dimensions. If we consider TS as a repository of all possible realities, dream states could be moments where our consciousness taps into different slices of TS, experiencing realities that are not part of our usual wakeful experience. The Holographic Principle could potentially play a role here, with the dream experiences being projections from the two-dimensional encoded information of TS.\n    \n3. **Schr\u00f6dinger's Equation and Total Simultaneity**: We discussed Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger's contributions to quantum mechanics and his philosophical musings on consciousness and reality. Schr\u00f6dinger's equation describes how the wave function of a quantum system evolves over time. If we consider TS as a timeless dimension, the wave function could be seen as a tool that our consciousness uses to navigate through the different states in TS, collapsing the wave function when a specific state is selected and brought into our perceived reality. The ER=EPR conjecture could provide a quantum-level explanation for this process, with entangled particles serving as the links between the selected state in TS and our conscious experience.\n    \n4. **Non-Dual Consciousness and Total Simultaneity**: The concept of non-dual consciousness, where there is no separation between the observer and the observed, aligns well with the idea of TS. If all possible states of the universe exist simultaneously in TS, then the distinction between subject and object could be an illusion created by our limited perception. The Holographic Principle supports this idea by suggesting that our perceived reality is a projection from a more fundamental level of existence. The ER=EPR conjecture adds another layer to this, suggesting that the connections between seemingly separate entities in our universe could be direct and immediate, further supporting the idea of non-dual consciousness.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/ergodic theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/ergodic theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "78534d9edddad0274f7dec9ce101c326d7b5ade1d04385a2facfb04df43e2d55", "text": "Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of dynamical systems and their long-term behavior. It focuses on the statistical properties of these systems, particularly how they evolve over time and how they distribute their states.\n\nThe central concept in ergodic theory is that of an ergodic system. An ergodic system is one in which the time average of a property or observable of the system is equal to its ensemble average. In other words, as the system evolves, it explores all possible states in a way that is representative of the entire system.\n\nErgodic theory draws [[connections]] between dynamical systems, [[probability]] theory, and statistical mechanics. It provides tools and techniques for analyzing the behavior of complex systems, such as [[chaotic]] systems, where long-term predictions are difficult.\n\nIn the context of computer science and brain research, ergodic theory can be used to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems, including [[neural networks]] and information processing systems. It helps in understanding how these systems evolve and distribute their states over [[Time]], which can be valuable for studying [[patterns]], information flow, and computational properties.\n\nErgodic theory, in the most general sense, is the study of the long-term behavior of dynamical systems. It originates from the field of statistical mechanics, where it was used to link the microscopic (individual particles) and macroscopic (statistical ensembles) descriptions of physical systems. The core idea of ergodicity is that, given sufficient time, a system will explore all available states in its phase space.\n\nApplying this to [[neural networks]], particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we can see some parallels. Neural networks can be viewed as dynamical systems, with their state evolving over time during the learning process. Each state in this context is a particular configuration of the weights and biases in the network. The phase space, in this case, consists of all possible configurations of these parameters.\n\nIn an ergodic system, every part of the phase space would eventually be explored. However, in the context of training neural networks, this is typically not what we want. Instead, we want the learning process to converge towards a state (i.e., a configuration of weights and biases) that minimizes the loss function, rather than to explore all possible states. \n\nIn recent years, some researchers have started to look at the ergodic properties of neural networks, in an attempt to better understand the behavior of these systems during training. The connections between ergodic theory and neural networks is still a growing field, and could potentially offer novel insights into the behavior and optimization of neural networks.\n\nOne application of ergodic theory in machine learning has been in the field of reinforcement learning. Ergodicity has been used as a metric to guide exploration-exploitation trade-offs and as a measure of the representational capacity of the state space.\n\nWhile the full depth of connections between ergodic theory and neural networks is still an open area of research, it is clear that the mathematical tools and concepts from ergodic theory have the potential to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of learning in neural networks.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/event horizon.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/event horizon.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/excitability.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/excitability.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "37e4cfeadef3380e5c66d9605338404ec4cd7a65bcc413b0dc03fd27d3865f9a", "text": "The excitability of neurons refers to their ability to generate electrical signals, or action potentials, in response to stimuli.

The excitability of neurons can be influenced by various factors, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and ion channels.\n\nThese electrical signals are called action potentials, which are brief and rapid changes in the membrane potential of the neuron.

What you're referencing here relates to research conducted by physicist Richard Taylor and his colleagues, who have extensively studied the impact of [[fractals]] in nature and art on the human brain.\n\nA core aspect of their findings is the hypothesis that the human visual system is essentially \"tuned\" to efficiently process [[fractals]] with a dimensionality between 1.3 and 1.5, since these are the most commonly observed [[fractals|fractal]] dimensions in nature. This could explain why we are often drawn to these [[patterns]], as they are aesthetically pleasing and familiar to our visual system. \n\nMoreover, Taylor and his team discovered that viewing images with these [[fractals|fractal]] dimensions can induce a relaxed state and potentially reduce stress levels significantly. This could be linked to the idea that these [[fractals|fractal]] patterns remind us of natural environments, which we find soothing and restorative. It's also possible that our brains use less energy to process these familiar patterns, which could contribute to feelings of relaxation.\n\nHowever, while these studies provide interesting insights, more research is needed to fully understand the intricate relationship between [[fractals]], the human brain, and our overall psychological well-being [[mood]]. Also, these studies primarily focus on visual perception of [[fractals]]. It's still unclear how these findings may translate to other types of [[fractals|fractal]] patterns in nature and in our bodies, such as those found in [[neural oscillations]].\n\nWhen we view fractal patterns, especially those with dimensions that we commonly encounter in nature, our brains can exhibit increased alpha and beta wave activity. [[alpha waves]] are typically associated with a state of relaxed, calm, yet alert awareness, often seen when we are quietly resting or [[meditation]]. Beta waves, on the other hand, are usually linked with active thinking, focus, and concentration.\n\nInterestingly, fractal patterns appear to stimulate not only the visual processing areas of the brain but also areas related to spatial [[memory]] and emotional response. For instance, fractal patterns can elicit activity in the parahippocampal cortex, a region involved in spatial orientation and [[memory]]. These patterns can also stimulate the [[amygdala]], which plays a significant role in emotional responses ([[mood]])\n\nMoreover, some researchers have suggested that fractal patterns in visual stimuli, such as artworks or natural scenes, might have a similar impact on our brains as listening to music.

Here's a deeper exploration of the connections between fractals, computer science, the brain, and nature:\n\nMathematical Fractals: Fractals are geometric objects that display self-similarity at different scales. They are generated using mathematical functions or algorithms, often involving [[recursive]] iterations. Examples include the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and the Sierpinski triangle. Mathematical fractals are precise representations of intricate patterns and structures, capturing the beauty of [[infinite]] [[complexity]] within finite equations.\n\nComputer Science and Fractals: Fractals have numerous applications in computer science. They are used in computer graphics, digital image processing, terrain generation, data compression, and more. Fractal-based algorithms enable the creation of realistic landscapes, natural textures, and visually stunning visual effects. Fractal compression techniques exploit the self-similar properties of fractals to achieve efficient [[data transmission]].\n\nFractals in the Brain: The human brain exhibits fractal patterns in various aspects of its functioning. [[neural oscillations]], such as those measured by electroencephalography (EEG), display fractal characteristics with self-similarity across different time scales. These fractal patterns reflect the complex and adaptive nature of brain activity, suggesting a balance between order and [[chaos]] in neural dynamics.\n\n[[neural networks]] and Fractals: Fractal-inspired algorithms are used in the field of artificial neural networks. Fractal neural network architectures leverage the self-similar properties of fractals to enhance learning and pattern recognition capabilities. These architectures mimic the hierarchical organization of the brain, with self-repeating patterns of connections and layers.\n\nFractals in Nature: Nature is replete with fractal patterns, ranging from the branching of trees and the veins in leaves to the intricate shapes of coastlines and clouds. Fractal geometry provides a framework to describe and understand these natural phenomena, revealing the underlying order and complexity in the natural world. Fractals also appear in biological systems, such as the branching patterns of blood vessels, the structure of lungs, and the organization of neuronal networks in the brain.\n\nThe exploration of fractals in mathematics, computer science, the brain, and nature highlights the profound [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] of these domains. It reveals the underlying principles that govern the formation and organization of complex systems, from the intricate shapes of mathematical fractals to the self-similar patterns found in our natural environment and within the neural networks of our brains.\n\n\n\nIn the strictest sense, mathematical fractals, as defined by Benoit Mandelbrot, are indeed \"forever in harmony with themselves\" due to their self-similarity and scale invariance. This means that no matter how much you zoom into or out of a fractal, you will always see the same pattern repeating over and over again. This level of harmony and consistency is an inherent property of fractal geometry.\n\nHowever, when we start to look at real-world phenomena that exhibit fractal-like properties, things become much more complex. Many natural systems, such as coastlines, mountains, clouds, and even the patterns of [[neuron|neurons]] in the brain, exhibit fractal-like characteristics but are not perfect fractals due to elements of randomness and entropy, as you mentioned.\n\nThese systems do indeed appear to constantly seek a state of balance between the inherent order of their fractal-like structure and the [[chaos]] and unpredictability introduced by external forces and internal randomness. This ongoing process of adaptation and evolution can potentially give rise to [[emergent]] properties, such as complex behaviors, [[Consciousness]], and perhaps even phenomena that could be described as \"free will\".\n\n\n\nA fractal system always seeks balance between chaos and order\n\n\n\nFractal systems are often described as exhibiting self-similarity and scale invariance, which means that they display the same level of complexity no matter the scale at which they are observed. This property gives them a certain form of \"order\". However, their structure is often highly irregular and unpredictable, lending them a quality of \"chaos\" as well.\n\nThe dynamic interplay between order and chaos is a key characteristic of many complex systems, not just fractals. For example, in the human body, a balance between order (homeostasis) and chaos (random fluctuations and responses to external stimuli) is essential for health.\n\nIn a more mathematical and scientific context, fractals are seen at the border between order (periodic behavior) and chaos (random behavior). This is particularly clear in the study of chaotic dynamical systems, where the so-called \"strange attractors\" that govern the system's behavior often have a fractal structure.\n\nSo, in summary, you could indeed say that fractal systems \"seek a balance between chaos and order\", in the sense that they exhibit both ordered, self-similar patterns and unpredictable, chaotic variations. However, it's important to note that this is a somewhat metaphorical description; fractals and other complex systems don't \"seek\" anything in a conscious or goal-directed sense. Instead, this balance emerges naturally from the underlying mathematical properties of the system.\n\n\nFractals are [[hologram]].\u00a0 They stem from the [[phi]] ratio, which stems from the pentagon, which stems from the circle.\u00a0 Fractals can be seen in all aspects of nature.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/fractional quantum Hall effect.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/fractional quantum Hall effect.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a683c23674a5aed69f504f771cd6e01b7d69b4d041626e6e22f56e80ecf66d7a", "text": "\n\nFractional Charge\n\nNormally, we think of elementary particles like [[electrons]] as having a fixed charge.

It illustrates the richness of quantum physics and how collective behavior can give rise to entirely new phenomena that cannot be understood by simply looking at individual particles. It's a deep subject that connects many areas of physics and continues to be an active area of research and exploration.\n\nHere's a bit more detail about the fractional quantum Hall effect and why it's significant:\n\n1. **Integer Quantum Hall Effect**: The integer quantum Hall effect occurs when the Hall conductance, which is the voltage difference across a sample in response to a current in a magnetic field, takes on [[quantization|quantized]] integral values. It can be explained using non-interacting [[electrons]] and is a clear demonstration of the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n2. **Fractional Quantum Hall Effect**: In the fractional quantum Hall regime, the Hall conductance takes on [[quantization|quantized]] fractional values. Unlike the IQHE, the FQHE cannot be understood without considering the interactions between [[electrons]]. The FQHE reflects the correlated motion of [[electrons]] and emerges only in specific conditions, such as low temperatures and high magnetic fields.\n\n3. **Composite [[fermions]]**: One way to understand the FQHE is by introducing composite [[fermions]], which are combinations of [[electrons]] bound with an even number of magnetic flux [[quanta]]. The physics then resembles the IQHE of these composite [[fermions]], giving rise to the fractional [[quantization]] of the Hall conductance.\n\n4. **[[anyons]] and [[topological|Topology]]**: The FQHE also leads to the emergence of anyonic excitations, exotic particles with statistical properties that are neither fermionic nor bosonic. The exchange of [[anyons]] around one another leads to a change in the quantum state of the system, something that doesn't happen with [[fermions]] or [[bosons]]. This is related to the concept of [[Braiding]] that you asked about earlier.\n\n5. **Applications in Quantum Computation**: The anyonic excitations in FQHE systems have been proposed as a possible platform for [[topological]] quantum computation. By controlling and manipulating the [[Braiding]] of [[anyons]], it might be possible to carry out fault-tolerant quantum computations.\n\n6. **Fundamental Insights**: The study of the FQHE has led to deep insights into the nature of quantum phases of matter and the role of interactions and topology in quantum physics. It has helped physicists develop new mathematical tools and approaches to understand strongly correlated systems.\n\n7. **Nobel Prize**: The discovery of the FQHE was so groundbreaking that it led to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics to Horst L. St\u00f6rmer, Daniel C. Tsui, and Robert B. Laughlin in 1998.\n\nThe fractional quantum Hall effect is an incredibly rich subject that sits at the intersection of quantum physics, condensed matter physics, and mathematics. It continues to be an area of active research and exploration, providing both fundamental insights into the nature of matter and potential applications in emerging technologies like [[Quantum Computing]].\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/frequency.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/frequency.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "08037f31f7739ae018aed6b7059c34fc67f3c5cb69ba4489f9ec0d064e0ced78", "text": "visual cortex responds to frequencies of various wave forms \near is a frequency analyzer \ntaste and skin frequency analyzer?\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/fundamental constants.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/fundamental constants.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "ab1ee6d15bf45feaf59ccaa4dbc3e83182f6ad8f457b3441f2a374ff67d1fa86", "text": "**1.) The fine-structure constant**, or the strength of the electromagnetic interaction. In terms of some of the physical constants we\u2019re more familiar with, this is a ratio of the elementary charge (of, say, an electron) squared to [[Planck]]\u2019s constant and the speed of light. But if you put these constants together, you get a dimensionless number!

All of these particles can be created at LHC energies, and the masses of the particles lead to fundamental constants that are absolutely necessary to describe them fully._\u00a0(E. SIEGEL / BEYOND THE GALAXY)\n\n**3\u201317.) The masses of the six [[quark|quarks]], six leptons, and three massive [[bosons]]**. This one is a bit of a disappointment. We have fifteen particles in the Standard Model: the six quarks, six leptons, the W, Z, and the Higgs bosons, all of which have a substantial rest mass. While it\u2019s true that their antiparticles all have identical rest masses, we were hoping that there would\u2019ve been some relationship, pattern, or more fundamental theory that gave rise to these masses with fewer parameters.\n\n!\n\n_The V-shaped track in the center of the image arises from a [[muon]] decaying to an electron and two neutrinos. The high-energy track with a kink in it is evidence of a mid-air particle decay. By colliding positrons and [[electrons]] at a specific, tunable energy, [[muon]]-antimuon pairs could be produced at will. The necessary energy for making a muon/antimuon pair from high-energy positrons colliding with electrons at rest is almost identical to the energy from electron/positron collisions necessary to create a Z-boson._\u00a0(THE SCOTTISH SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY ROADSHOW)\n\nThere may yet be, as some weird almost-perfect relations can be derived: collide a positron at 45 GeV with an electron at 45 GeV, and you have the right amount of energy to make a Z boson; collide a positron at 45 GeV with an electron at rest, and you have the right amount of energy to make a muon/anti-muon pair. Unfortunately, this relation is approximate and not exact; the energy to create a Z-boson is closer to 46 GeV; the energy to make a muon/anti-muon pair is closer to 44 GeV. If there is a true underlying theory that describes our particle masses, we have yet to discover it.\n\nAs a result, it takes fifteen constants to describe the known masses. The lone good news is that we can save ourselves another constant.

The neutrino mixing parameters**. Similar to the quark sector, there are four parameters that detail how neutrinos mix with one another, given that the three types of neutrino species all have the same quantum number. Although physicists initially hoped that neutrinos would be massless and not require additional constants, nature had other plans. The solar neutrino problem \u2014 where only a third of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun were arriving here on Earth \u2014 was one of the 20th century\u2019s biggest conundrums.\n\nIt was only solved when we realized that neutrinos:\n\n- had very small but non-zero masses,\n- mixed together,\n- and oscillated from one type into another.\n\nThe quark mixing is described by three angles and one CP-violating complex phase, and the neutrino mixing is described in the same way.

By comparing observed mass functions with predictions from simulations and theoretical models, scientists can refine our understanding of the underlying physics driving galaxy formation and evolution.\n\nFurthermore, the subhalo mass function is an essential tool for studying galaxy mergers, satellite galaxies, and the formation of galaxy clusters. It helps uncover the hierarchical assembly of structures and provides insights into the growth of galaxies over cosmic [[Time]].\n\nIn summary, the galactic subhalo mass function describes the distribution of masses of smaller subhalos within a galaxy or a galaxy cluster.

According to general relativity, the observed gravitational effect between masses results from their warping of [[space-time|spacetime]].\n\nKey principles of general relativity are:\n\n**1. Principle of Equivalence:** This is the idea that the force of [[gravity]] as experienced locally while standing on a massive body is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an [[observation|observer]] in a non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference.\n\n**2. Geometry of Spacetime:** Einstein proposed that the geometry of spacetime is curved by matter and [[energy]]. Spacetime tells matter how to move, and matter tells spacetime how to curve. This is often summed up in John Archibald [[Wheeler]]'s phrase, \"Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.\"\n\n**3. Light Cones and the Structure of Spacetime:** The paths of light rays are described by [[null geodesics]] in the spacetime, and general relativity describes the bending of light in a gravitational field.\n\n**4. [[black hole]]s and Event Horizons:** One of the most striking predictions of general relativity is the existence of [[black hole|black holes]], regions of spacetime where the curvature becomes extreme and nothing, not even light, can escape.\n\n**5. [[Gravitational Waves]]:** Just as a moving charge will emit electromagnetic waves, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses will emit gravitational waves. These waves were directly detected for the first time by the LIGO observatory in 2015.\n\nThe mathematics of general relativity is complex, involving tensor calculus and differential geometry. The key equation is Einstein's field equation, which relates the curvature of spacetime (the Einstein tensor) to the distribution of matter and energy (the stress-energy tensor):\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0T\u03bc\u03bd\n\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd is the Einstein tensor (which describes the curvature of spacetime), T\u03bc\u03bd is the stress-energy tensor (which describes the distribution of matter and energy), and \u03c0 is the mathematical constant pi. \n\nThe solutions to these equations give metrics, which describe the geometry of spacetime, and these can be used to predict the motion of particles and light. \n\nGeneral relativity has passed many experimental tests and is a cornerstone of modern physics. However, it is not compatible with quantum mechanics, and reconciling the two remains a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/geodesic paths.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/geodesic paths.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "f56de4109290748e49dd88f7b3f6aa926231b3f46624215d55ba0467b226d262", "text": "Geodesic paths, also known as geodesics, are the shortest or longest curves between two points in a given space.

But hidden at the heart of it is a tension. If gravity can be treated as a fluid, then what about [[turbulence]]? \n\nPrevious simulations at Perimeter, and independent work out of MIT, had hinted that there could be turbulence around the non-realistic case of\u00a0black holes\u00a0confined in anti-de Sitter space. \"There might be turbulence if you confine gravity in a box, essentially,\" says Lehner. \"The deeper question is whether this can happen in a realistic situation.\"\nThe team decided to study fast-spinning black holes, because a fluid-dynamics description of such holes hints that the spacetime around them is less viscous than the spacetime around other kinds of black holes. Low viscosity increases the chance of turbulence \u2013 think of the way water is more swirly than molasses.\nThe team also decided to study non-linear perturbations of the black holes. Gravitational systems are rarely analyzed at this level of detail, as the equations are fiendishly complex. But, knowing that turbulence is fundamentally non-linear, the team decided a non-linear perturbation analysis was exactly what was called for.\nIf gravitation can be turbulent, then those ripples might be a bit different than previous models suggest. Knowing about these differences may make gravitational waves easier to spot. And, of course, actually detecting these differences would be direct evidence of gravitational turbulence.\nThis research strengthens the idea that gravity can be treated as a fluid \u2013 which also means that fluids can be treated gravitationally.\n\"We've been stuck for over 500 years on achieving a full understanding of turbulence,\" says Lehner. \"This gravity/fluid correspondence tells us that there is a way to use gravitational tools and gravitational intuition to take a fresh look at turbulence. We may end up as stuck as we are in our standard approach, or we may end up shedding completely new light that helps the field go forward. It's very exciting.\"\n\n\nThe research into gravity/fluid duality and gravitational turbulence can be related to several topics you've asked about before.\n\n1. **[[holographic principle]] and [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]]**: The AdS/CFT correspondence, which is a particular example of holographic duality, establishes a connection between a gravity theory in a higher-dimensional space and a field theory in one lower dimension. This principle allows physicists to translate difficult problems in one theory into more tractable problems in the other. In a similar manner, the gravity/fluid duality seeks to translate problems in gravitational physics (like turbulence around black holes) into problems in fluid dynamics, and vice versa.\n\n2. [[Quantum Entanglement]] and [[ER=EPR]]: The ER=EPR conjecture postulates a deep connection between quantum entanglement (EPR) and Einstein-Rosen bridges, or wormholes (ER). The potential for gravitational turbulence, as implied by the gravity/fluid duality, could have implications for the way we understand this connection, and how we understand quantum entanglement and wormholes.\n\n3. Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]]: Bohm's idea of the implicate (hidden, enfolded) order and the explicate (manifest, unfolded) order can also find some parallel in the gravity/fluid duality. The gravity/fluid duality suggests that the behavior of a complex gravitational system (like the space-time around a spinning [[black hole]]) can be \"unfolded\" from a simpler, lower-dimensional fluid system.\n\n4. **Fractal Structures and [[chaos theory]]**: Turbulence is a classic example of a chaotic system, and the patterns of turbulence often have [[fractals|fractal]] structures. The possible existence of turbulence in gravitational systems may thus resonate with your questions about [[chaos theory]], [[fractals]], and the strange attractors of the Mandelbrot set.\n\n5. [[endocannabinoid system]] and Space-Time: This one might seem a bit of a stretch, but bear with me. If gravity can manifest turbulence, and turbulence can be understood through a fluid dynamical lens due to gravity/fluid duality, then we have a model for how high-level systems (like the endocannabinoid system in the body, or the gravity of a spinning [[black hole]]) might exhibit complex, chaotic behavior due to underlying fundamental dynamics (like the motion of fluid particles, or the curvature of space-time).\n   \nIn conclusion, the potential discovery of gravitational [[turbulence]] would impact various aspects of physics, and it can indeed be related to many of the topics you've previously asked about. It exemplifies how different physical theories and phenomena can be [[interconnected]] in unexpected ways.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/gravity.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/gravity.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "4867441a1f2d7afb7bf6645584fb43f84353a799ed639111ead2431692cea0e9", "text": "We often refer to gravity as a gravitational field because it can be described mathematically as a field.

If both the past and present are real and fixed, the question arises about what it means for something to change over time. Critics argue that this might lead to a static view of [[reality]], although there are counterarguments to these criticisms from proponents of the GBU.\n\nA significant challenge for the GBU is its lack of direct support from contemporary physics, especially relativity, which more closely aligns with Eternalism. Some see this lack of scientific support as making the GBU untenable, while others believe that it might be reconciled with future advancements in physics.\n\nThe idea that the future does not exist and is therefore open has implications for human freedom, responsibility, and [[causality]].

This distinction allows the GBU to preserve the reality of the past, while still giving a role to the unfolding and growth of time.\n\nOverall, the Growing Block [[universe]] offers an intriguing view of time, providing an intuitive depiction of time as something continually unfolding and growing. It continues to stimulate debate and discussion among philosophers and scholars, appealing to those who see time as something more dynamic and open-ended, while still preserving the concrete reality of the past.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/hadrons.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/hadrons.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0157b8e5fa69d8ae58f79073cf7e3acbc82cff0c739c5bca78586288a7f39f5f", "text": "Hadrons are particles that are composed of quarks and are subject to the [[strong nuclear force]]. They are a family of particles that includes both baryons and mesons.\n\nBaryons are hadrons made up of three quarks. The most well-known baryons are protons and neutrons, which are the building blocks of atomic nuclei. Protons are composed of two up quarks and one down [[quark]], while neutrons consist of two down quarks and one up quark. Baryons exhibit a property called baryon number, which is a conserved quantum number that helps distinguish them from other particles.\n\nMesons, on the other hand, are hadrons composed of a quark and an antiquark. They are often referred to as quark-antiquark bound states. Examples of mesons include pions, kaons, and eta mesons. Pions, for instance, are composed of an up quark and an anti-down quark or a down quark and an anti-up quark. Mesons have a net charge of zero and do not possess baryon number.\n\nHadrons interact via the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by [[gluon|gluons]]. Gluons are massless particles that carry the color charge and are responsible for holding quarks together within hadrons. The strong force is the strongest of the fundamental forces, but it has a limited range, operating mainly at the scale of atomic nuclei.\n\nThe study of hadrons is a key aspect of particle physics and is important for understanding the nature of matter and the behavior of quarks and gluons within the strong interaction. Hadrons play a significant role in the structure of atomic nuclei and the dynamics of nuclear reactions. The classification and properties of hadrons are described by the theories of quantum chromodynamics ([[QCD]]), which is the [[Quantum Field Theory]] that describes the strong interaction.\n\nIn a hadron, quarks are held together by the strong force, mediated by gluons. These gluons are exchanged between quarks and are responsible for the attractive force that confines the quarks within the hadron.\n\nQuarks and gluons inside a hadron are continually interacting, with quarks changing color charge via gluon exchange and gluons themselves interacting and forming gluon chains or loops. These interactions create a complex web of relationships where the properties of one particle (like its color charge) become correlated with the properties of others.\n\nThis correlation leads to a situation where the individual quarks inside a hadron are not in definite states themselves but are in a [[superposition]] of states. The state of each quark is intricately linked with the states of the others, forming an entangled state. If you were to make a measurement on one quark, it would instantly determine the state of the other quarks, no matter the spatial separation within the hadron.\n\nThe concept of [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] is at the core of quantum mechanics and has led to profound philosophical debates about the nature of reality. It defies our classical intuition, allowing particles to be instantaneously connected despite being separated in space.\n\nIn the context of a hadron, this entanglement is also related to the phenomenon of [[confinement]], where quarks are never found alone in isolation but are always confined within composite particles like protons and neutrons. Attempts to pull quarks apart only lead to the creation of new quark-antiquark pairs.\n\nThe entanglement of quarks inside a hadron represents a concrete and physically essential instance of quantum entanglement and [[non-locality]], tying together aspects of particle physics, [[Quantum Field Theory]], and the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It exemplifies the richness and complexity of the strong force and the behavior of matter on subatomic scales.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/hallucinations.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/hallucinations.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "10439325eb084fa5c48ae7b6563085288fe5a05484f95d3c760ef6465e8602e3", "text": "---\naliases: hallucinogenic\n---\n\nPsychedelic substances, such as LSD, psilocybin (found in magic [[mushrooms]]), and mescaline, produce their effects by interacting with the brain's neurochemistry, especially with the serotonin system. Here's a general overview of how this process might contribute to hallucinations and altered perceptions:\n\n1. **Serotonin and the 5-HT2A receptor**: Many psychedelics have a similar structure to serotonin, a key neurotransmitter that regulates various brain functions including mood, appetite, and cognition. These substances primarily exert their effects by binding to a specific subtype of [[serotonin]] receptor known as the 5-HT2A receptor. When a psychedelic substance binds to this receptor, it stimulates it in a different way than serotonin does, leading to altered sensory and perceptual experiences.\n\n2. **Disruption of thalamic gating**: The [[thalamus]] is a brain region that acts like a relay station, filtering sensory information and sending it to the appropriate areas of the cortex for further processing. Under normal circumstances, the thalamus allows only a small amount of sensory information to pass to the cortex. But when the serotonin system is stimulated by a psychedelic, this gating mechanism may be disrupted, allowing more information to flood into the cortex. This could contribute to the sensory overload and blending of sensory modalities (known as [[synesthesia]]) often reported during psychedelic experiences.\n\n4. **Increased brain [[Connectivity]]**: Brain imaging studies have shown that psychedelics increase [[Connectivity]] between different regions of the brain that don't normally communicate. This could lead to unusual thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, including hallucinations.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exact mechanisms by which psychedelics induce hallucinations and altered states of [[Consciousness]] are still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research. [[unknown]]Moreover, the effects of these substances can be highly variable and depend on many factors, including the specific substance, dose, individual's mindset, and the environment in which the substance is taken.\n\nAs for psychedelics like LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline, these primarily exert their hallucinogenic effects by interacting with the serotonin system, specifically the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. However, the [[endocannabinoid system]] does appear to interact and overlap with the serotonin system in complex ways, and it is known to play a role in modulating various aspects of brain function and perception.\n\nWhile it's clear that the [[endocannabinoid system]] plays a crucial role in neuromodulation and the regulation of mood, [[memory]], pain perception, and other functions, its specific involvement in the hallucinogenic effects of psychedelics is not well understood and is likely to be indirect. \n\nAs of my last update in September 2021, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between the endocannabinoid system, the serotonin system, and the effects of psychedelic substances. It's an intriguing area of study, and future research could yield important insights into the brain, perception, and the nature of [[Consciousness]].\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/hermeticism.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/hermeticism.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "ae307e534535b1f12fc18f2e9cead6803d44c4b94e8b830b4e25f21e4b5e2101", "text": "Hermeticism, a philosophical and religious tradition based on the teachings of the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus, is a rich tradition that includes beliefs in astrology, alchemy, and theosophy.

Its central tenet is encapsulated in the phrase \"As above, so below\" which implies that the microcosm (the individual or the small scale) and the macrocosm (the cosmos or the large scale) are intimately connected and reflect each other.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Hermetic philosophy is the belief in a single, ultimate reality or principle from which everything else in the universe emanates\u2014a principle often referred to as \"The All\" or \"The One.\" In this view, all beings are considered to be manifestations or expressions of this One, which implies a fundamental oneness or unity of all existence.

[[Quantum Entanglement]] and [[non-locality]]: The Hermetic principles of correspondence (\"As above, so below\") and [[connection]] might resonate with these phenomena.

Of these, gravity is extraordinarily weak compared to the others. For example, consider the fact that a small magnet can lift a paper clip against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth. This suggests that the force of gravity is many orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetism.\n\nNow, this difference is strange, but why is it a \"problem\"? The problem arises when we attempt to merge quantum mechanics with gravity. Quantum mechanics introduces an inherent uncertainty that results in \"fluctuations\", leading particles to have temporary, \"virtual\" interactions with other particles. These interactions can influence the masses of the particles.\n\nFor most particles, these fluctuations aren't an issue because either their masses are protected by certain [[symmetry|symmetries]], or the fluctuations are at a scale where they don't dramatically affect the observed mass. The [[Higgs boson]], however, is different. Its mass seems to be very sensitive to these fluctuations and, in the absence of a protective symmetry, it \"feels\" effects from [[virtual particles]] at all energy scales up to the so-called [[Planck]] scale, where [[quantum gravity]] effects become important.\n\nIf we calculate the contributions to the Higgs mass from these [[quantum fluctuations]] without any new physics, we find that its mass should be around the Planck scale, which is about 10^19 times larger than the mass measured at the Large Hadron Collider! \n\nThis enormous discrepancy between where the Higgs mass \"should be\" and where it actually is represents the hierarchy problem. Why is the Higgs boson so much lighter than naive quantum mechanical calculations predict?\n\nOne solution to the hierarchy problem is [[supersymmetry]], which introduces new particles that exactly cancel out the quantum fluctuations contributing to the Higgs mass. However, as of my last update in September 2021, no evidence for supersymmetry has been found. This leaves the hierarchy problem as one of the big unsolved problems in theoretical physics, with implications for the search for new physics beyond the [[standard model]].\n\nSeveral solutions to the hierarchy problem have been proposed:\n\n1. **[[supersymmetry]] (SUSY)**: This postulates a symmetry between [[bosons]] and [[fermions]]. In the supersymmetrical theory, every known particle has a heavier \"superpartner\" which effectively cancels out their contributions to the Higgs mass. However, as of my last training cut-off in September 2021, none of these superpartner particles have been discovered.\n    \n2. **Technicolor**: This theory proposes a new interaction, similar to the strong force that binds quarks within protons and neutrons, that could protect the Higgs boson mass from large quantum corrections. However, technicolor theories tend to be very complex and have problems agreeing with precision measurements.\n    \n3. **Extra Dimensions**: Theories such as [[String theory]] posit the existence of additional spatial dimensions beyond the familiar three. In these theories, gravity may be \"diluted\" in the other dimensions, explaining its relative weakness and the Higgs boson mass discrepancy.\n    \n4. **Composite Higgs**: In these theories, the Higgs is not an elementary particle but is a composite, similar to how protons and neutrons are composed of [[quark|quarks]]. If the Higgs is composite, then its light mass could be the result of a new, yet unknown, strong force.\n    \n5. **Anthropic Principle**: This is a more philosophical approach, which suggests that we see the Higgs boson mass as small because only in a universe with such a Higgs mass could life (and therefore physicists) exist.\n    \n6. **Quantum Gravity/[[loop quantum gravity]]**: These theories posit that at the smallest scales, space-time is not smooth but quantized.

The most famous and well-studied example of this duality is the AdS/CFT correspondence, proposed by Juan Maldacena in 1997. \n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence, short for Anti-de Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory correspondence, is a type of holographic duality. It provides a mathematical equivalence between a quantum gravity theory in a certain spacetime (Anti-de Sitter space, or AdS) and a quantum field theory without gravity, defined at the boundary of that spacetime (Conformal Field Theory, or CFT). \n\nThe boundary CFT lives in a lower dimensional space, giving the correspondence its 'holographic' character. In a sense, the physics in the higher-dimensional AdS space (including its gravitational dynamics) is completely described by the physics happening at its boundary in terms of a quantum field theory.\n\nThis correspondence provides a valuable tool for studying quantum gravity because it allows us to use well-understood techniques from [[Quantum Field Theory]] to gain insight into questions of gravity. This is particularly useful because [[quantum gravity]] is not yet fully understood, and traditional approaches to combining quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]], such as straightforward [[quantization]] of the gravitational field, run into serious issues, most notably the problem of [[non-renormalizability]].\n\nThe [[holographic principle]], from which the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory]] arises, goes even further to suggest that all of the information contained in a volume of space can be represented as information on the boundary of that space, similar to a hologram, which is a 2D surface that contains all the information necessary to describe a 3D object.\n\nWhile the AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic principle are tools that have yielded valuable insights into quantum gravity and the nature of [[black hole|black holes]], it's important to note that these are still theoretical constructs that have yet to be directly confirmed by experiment. Nonetheless, they continue to serve as guiding principles in our pursuit of a quantum theory of gravity.\n\nNow, the fascinating connection proposed between these is the [[ER=EPR]] conjecture, posited by Maldacena and Susskind, which we discussed earlier. Under this conjecture, [[Quantum Entanglement|quantum entangled]] particles are connected by a sort of micro wormhole. This suggests a deep and fundamental connection between quantum mechanics and [[gravity]].\n\nIn the context of the [[holographic principle]], a wormhole in the higher-dimensional gravitational theory (AdS space) can be described by entangled pairs of particles in the lower-dimensional boundary theory (CFT).\n\nA key insight from these ideas is that [[space-time|spacetime]] itself may be fundamentally built from [[Quantum Entanglement]].

The researchers posit that the holographic principle could be a crucial clue in successfully combining quantum mechanics and gravity. This principle, similar to a hologram projecting a three-dimensional image from a two-dimensional screen, allows physicists to study gravitational systems by projecting them on a boundary that envelops the entire universe.\n\nThe study employs the AdS/CFT correspondence, developed by Juan Maldacena, as it provides a precise mathematical definition of the holographic principle. The researchers, Hirosi Ooguri, the Director of the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, and Daniel Harlow, an Assistant Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, demonstrate that symmetry is not feasible in a gravitational theory that obeys the holographic principle.\n\nTheir work builds on previous research by Harlow and others which found a precise mathematical analogy between the holographic principle and quantum error-correcting codes, mechanisms that safeguard information in a quantum computer. Ooguri and Harlow's research establishes that such quantum error-correcting codes are not compatible with any symmetry, implying that symmetry would not be possible in quantum gravity.\n\nThis conclusion has several important implications, notably predicting the stability of protons against decay into other elementary particles and the existence of magnetic monopoles.\n\n\n\n**Holographic Mapping Discovered by Ooguri and Collaborators:**\u00a0The mathematical formula relates local data in the extra dimensions of the gravitational theory, depicted by the red point, are expressed in terms of quantum entanglements, depicted by the blue domes. \n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/holographic principle.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/holographic principle.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "58f2c6f5f73d230454b54d7bc85e0f994870f2e1398e32ad3cb85492cc60201d", "text": "---\naliases: holography\n---\n\nThe holographic principle is a concept in [[String theory]] that has profound implications for our understanding of space, time, and information.

When you tilt the card, you can see a three-[[dimensional]] image, even though the hologram itself is just a flat, two-dimensional surface. The holographic principle suggests that the [[universe]] might operate in a similar way, with a lower-dimensional boundary encoding information about a higher-dimensional space.\n\n2. [[Black Hole Entropy]]: The holographic principle grew out of attempts to understand the entropy (a measure of disorder) of black holes. Theoretical physicist Jacob Bekenstein and physicist Stephen Hawking found that a [[black hole]]'s entropy is proportional to the area of its [[event horizon]] (the \"point of no return\" around a black hole) rather than its volume. This was surprising because it suggested that the maximum amount of information contained in a region of space is proportional to the area of the region's boundary, not its volume. This is what led to the holographic principle.\n\n3. [[Holographic Universe Theory]]: The idea has been taken even further to suggest that our entire universe might be a hologram.

Here's a brief explanation of these ideas:\n\n1. Explicate Order: The explicate order refers to the visible, manifest, or observable world that we perceive and experience. It includes the physical objects, events, and phenomena that can be directly observed and described using classical physics. In this order, things are seen as separate, distinct entities with well-defined properties.\n\n2. Implicate Order: The implicate order, also known as the enfolded order, is the underlying, non-manifest, or hidden order that gives rise to the explicate order. It represents a deeper level of reality beyond our direct sensory perception. In the implicate order, everything is [[interconnected]], interrelated, and enfolded within a unified whole. It is a holistic and undivided realm where boundaries between objects are blurred.\n\nAccording to [Bohm]], the implicate order contains the potential for various explicate manifestations. The explicate order unfolds or enfolds from the implicate order, and the relationship between the two is dynamic and [[interconnected]. Bohm proposed that this understanding of the implicate and explicate order can help explain the [[wave-particle duality]] and other paradoxical phenomena observed in quantum mechanics. \n\nIn the enfolded (or implicate) order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements. Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of [[space-time|spacetime]], along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order. These ordinary notions in fact appear in what is called the \"explicate\" or \"unfolded\" order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders \n(Bohm 1980, p. xv).\n\n\n\n**Consciousness and Perception**: Some have associated the implicate order with [[Consciousness]] itself. The notion that consciousness is fundamental in the universe and that our perceptions are what manifest the explicate order. This is similar to certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, where the observer plays a central role in the outcome of quantum events.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/implicate time.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/implicate time.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "c99620bbea1eceaa8dcca073d5f0d55e97d31180c8e38404da856c378db9314b", "text": "Imagine a cosmic tapestry, woven with threads of infinite possibilities. This tapestry is the Implicate Order, where [[Time]] is not linear but exists as a boundless ocean with waves of possibilities crashing and intermingling. Within this tapestry, there is no past, present, or future; all moments, all events, and all potentials exist simultaneously, enfolded within each other.\n\nNow, picture a cosmic loom that weaves these threads from the Implicate Order into a linear fabric. This loom is [[Consciousness]]. As Consciousness interacts with the Implicate Order, it pulls individual threads from the cosmic tapestry and begins to weave them into a linear narrative. This narrative is the Explicate Order \u2013 the [[reality]] that we experience, with a clear progression of past, present, and future.\n\nIn this Explicate Order, events seem to unfold in a sequence, like the frames of a film. Each moment in linear time is like a single stitch made by the cosmic loom. But, crucially, this stitch is not just created and left behind; it remains connected to the Implicate Order, as a thread still attached to the cosmic tapestry.\n\nAs we move through linear time, our consciousness acts like the needle of the loom, making choices and taking paths. However, since the threads are still connected to the Implicate Order, the infinite possibilities are always there, just beyond our perception.\n\nIn moments of creativity, deep insight, or during altered states of consciousness, we may feel as if we\u2019re briefly reaching into the Implicate Order, touching the cosmic tapestry directly. These are the moments that hint at the boundless possibilities that exist just beyond the linear progression of time.\n\nIn this metaphorical vision, linear time in the Explicate Order is like a story woven from the endless potentials of the Implicate Order, guided by the loom of Consciousness. The Explicate is not separate from the Implicate but is, in fact, a singular thread being drawn from an infinitely complex and beautiful tapestry.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/information theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/information theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "1c2f5aa358749b453c02800ad4c6640b9b17eea66fb777ed8539af88a8686b05", "text": "Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics and electrical engineering involving the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was fundamentally designed by Claude Shannon during the twentieth century and has been significantly expanded by many others over the years.\n\nInformation theory introduces a number of concepts and measures that are now fundamental in not only telecommunications but also in computer science, linguistics, biology, physics, and other fields. Some of the key concepts in information theory include [[entropy]], mutual information, conditional [[entropy]], and information gain.\n\nHere's a brief description of these concepts:\n\n1. **[[entropy]]**: Entropy is a measure of unpredictability or randomness of the information being processed. The concept of entropy used in information theory is analogous to the concept of entropy in thermodynamics. The greater the \"randomness\" of the information, the more entropy it has.\n\n2. **Mutual Information**: This tells us how much two or more things share information. For example, it shows how knowing about one thing can make us less unsure about the others.\n\n3. **Conditional Entropy**: Also known as the expected or average conditional entropy, it quantifies the amount of information needed to describe the outcome of a random variable given that the value of another variable is known.\n\n4. **Information Gain**: This is a statistical property that measures how well a given attribute separates training examples according to their target classification. It's commonly used in machine learning, specifically in decision tree algorithms.\n\nInformation theory has also played a significant role in the development of cryptography, data compression, network coding, error detection and correction, and even in areas such as pattern recognition, neuroscience, and [[Quantum Computing]].

Moreover, my experience exists from its own intrinsic perspective, independent of external observers.\n\n2. **Composition**: Consciousness is structured: each experience is composed of multiple phenomenological distinctions, elementary or higher-order.\n\n3. **[[Information]]**: Consciousness is specific: each experience is what it is by differing in its particular way from other possible experiences. Thus, an experience of pure darkness and silence is what it is by differing, in its particular way, from an immense number of other possible experiences. A small subset of this vast repertoire is the set of all possible experiences of pure darkness. Even this subset is vast.\n\n4. **Integration**: Consciousness is unified: each experience is irreducible to non-interdependent, disjoint subsets of phenomenal distinctions.\n\n5. **Exclusion**: Consciousness is definite, in content and spatio-temporal grain: each experience has the set of phenomenal distinctions it has, in their particular mutual relation, neither less (a subset) nor more (a superset), and it flows at the speed it flows, neither slower nor faster.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/integrated information theory.md_part_2": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/integrated information theory.md_part_2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5fb9bc48631ff7d6518488a72a60019ca92e058373bb9317892cbb8d8a08ea13", "text": "\n\nMathematical formulation:\n\nThe integrated information \u03a6 of a system is then defined mathematically in a way that attempts to capture these principles.

In other words, it quantifies the degree of synergy or emergence in the system.\n\nImportantly, \u03a6 is not just a measure of the total amount of information in a system, but of the degree of integration of that information.

[[Gamma waves|Gamma]] oscillations are high-frequency oscillations in the range of 30 to 100 Hz and are thought to be involved in various cognitive functions such as attention, working [[memory]], and sensory perception. Studies have shown that ketamine administration can increase the power and synchronization of gamma oscillations, leading to enhanced cognitive processing.\n\nKetamine has also been found to modulate other types of neural oscillations, such as [[theta waves|theta]] and [[alpha waves]]. [[theta waves|Theta]] oscillations, occurring in the range of 4 to 8 Hz, are associated with [[memory]] processes and cognitive control. Ketamine administration can disrupt [[theta waves|theta]] oscillations, leading to impairments in [[memory]] and attention.\n\nOn the other hand, alpha oscillations, occurring in the range of 8 to 13 Hz, are related to relaxed and idle mental states. Ketamine has been shown to reduce the power of [[alpha waves]], which may contribute to the dissociative and psychedelic effects of the drug.\n\nKetamine is a dissociative anesthetic drug with [[hallucinations|hallucinogenic]] and pain-relieving properties. It is often used in medical settings for its anesthetic effects, but it is also used recreationally and, more recently, therapeutically for its unique effects on [[mood]] and perception. Some users report experiences on ketamine that are reminiscent of near-death experiences (NDEs). While the exact mechanisms behind these experiences are not fully understood, a few possibilities have been proposed:\n\n1. **NMDA Receptor Antagonism:** Ketamine primarily acts by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain, which are responsible for the transmission of electrical signals between [[neuron]]s in the brain. By blocking these receptors, ketamine alters the normal functioning of various brain regions, which can lead to changes in perception, thought, and [[mood]]. \n\n2. **Dissociation:** Ketamine is known for its potent dissociative effects, which can make users feel detached from their bodies and their surroundings. This can mimic the sensation of floating outside of one's body that is often reported in NDEs.\n\n3. **Altered Perception of Time:** Ketamine can greatly distort one's sense of [[Time]], making minutes seem like hours, or vice versa. This alteration in the perception of time may contribute to the feeling of entering a different realm or dimension, another common feature of NDEs.\n\n4. **Induction of Mystical Experiences:** Similar to other hallucinogens, ketamine can induce profound mystical or [[transcendental]] experiences that can feel incredibly real and meaningful to the user. These can include feelings of unity or [[oneness]] with the [[universe]], encounters with seemingly divine or otherworldly entities, or the sensation of traveling to other realms or dimensions.\n\nKetamine, a dissociative anesthetic and psychedelic, has been found in various studies to have a significant effect on the Default Mode Network ([[DMN]])\n\nKetamine EEGs mimics brain wave state of long term [[meditation]]\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/klein tunneling.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/klein tunneling.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3df797d8a789a470b307c688616c5f29d2b41ad53b24eb2abe3230a95fe249a3", "text": "https://phys.org/news/2019-06-quantum-portal-emerges-exotic-interface.html\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/knot theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/knot theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "58be098d926b6db8e3c0a385d6eec0ecba42f78b19a3cebca6d0dd90917c9328", "text": "\n\nBasics of Knots\n\n1. **Definition**: A mathematical knot is a closed, non-self-intersecting curve that is embedded in three dimensions.

Kundalini awakening or rising is described as this energy moving upwards through the chakras or energy centers, leading to spiritual awakening or enlightenment. \n\nHowever, this process is not always smooth or pleasant.

These laws describe the fundamental principles of heat, energy, and entropy, and provide a framework for understanding and analyzing various thermodynamic processes and systems.\n\nThere are four laws of thermodynamics, although the fourth law is sometimes considered an extension or a corollary of the other three. Here is a brief overview of the three main laws:\n\n1. First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation): The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only be transferred or transformed from one form to another. This law is often expressed as the conservation of energy principle, which states that the total energy of a closed system remains constant over [[Time]].\n\nMathematically, the first law is often written as:\n\u0394U = Q - W\nwhere \u0394U is the change in internal energy of the system, Q is the heat transferred into the system, and W is the work done by the system.\n\n2. Second Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Increased [[entropy]]): The second law states that the total [[entropy]] of an isolated system always increases over time. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It implies that natural processes tend to move towards a state of greater disorder or equilibrium.\n\nThe second law has several statements and formulations, including the Clausius statement and the [[Kelvin]]-[[Planck]] statement. One of the most well-known formulations is that heat flows spontaneously from a hotter object to a colder object, and it is not possible to completely convert heat into work without producing a net increase in [[entropy]].\n\n3. Third Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Absolute Zero): The third law states that as the temperature of a system approaches absolute zero (0 [[Kelvin]] or -273.15 degrees Celsius), the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value. This law establishes the zero point for entropy calculations and implies that it is impossible to reach absolute zero through a finite number of processes.\n\nThe fourth law, often referred to as the \"Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics,\" states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law allows the concept of temperature to be defined and provides a basis for the measurement and comparison of temperatures.\n\nTogether, these laws provide the foundation for understanding energy, heat, work, and the behavior of systems in thermodynamics. They have broad applications in various scientific and engineering fields, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and environmental science.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/locality.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/locality.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3b3f4be9b2c59a177812ef1ee8433cccc54825c4582b4872afde3a40e40f1403", "text": "Locality is a fundamental principle in physics which states that an object can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings.

This led to the famous debate between Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, culminating in the EPR paradox.\n\nIn the context of quantum field theory, the principle of locality is preserved in a subtle way through what's known as 'micro-causality', which essentially ensures that measurements at spacelike-separated points commute, and hence cannot influence each other.\n\nIn the context of the Wolfram Physics Project, locality refers to the way updating events in the hypergraph model can only involve a finite and typically small number of elements, echoing the concept that interactions happen locally in our familiar physical reality.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/loop quantum gravity.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/loop quantum gravity.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "977c50228ab8516965ee0a3f479d943d97117563bbf25baf7fb62860a9bda627", "text": "\n\nSolving the [[Wheeler-DeWitt Equation]]\n\nThe Wheeler-DeWitt equation, which aims to describe the quantum state of the universe, including its geometry, is a central problem in the quest for [[quantum gravity]].

In the MWI, the wave function of the universe never collapses (as it is postulated to do in some other interpretations), and its evolution is governed entirely by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], a deterministic equation.\n\nThis determinism stands in contrast to the inherent randomness found in interpretations like the Copenhagen Interpretation, which states that while we can predict [[probability|probabilities]], the actual outcome of a quantum event is fundamentally random.\n\nHowever, while the overall evolution of the wave function is deterministic in the MWI, our individual experiences within one of the \"worlds\" would still seem probabilistic. This is because each [[Time]] a quantum event happens, the universe \"splits\" into multiple non-interacting branches. The branch that any [[observation|observer]] ends up in is unpredictable and can be described probabilistically, giving the appearance of randomness on a subjective level, even though the overall process is deterministic.\n\nThe Many-Worlds Interpretation is inherently non-realistic because, until a measurement is made, a quantum system exists in a [[superposition]] of all possible states. When a measurement is made, all outcomes occur, each in its own separate world. Therefore, there's no need for \"hidden variables\" to determine the outcome of a quantum measurement in MWI.

These constructs are based on mathematical principles and equations and are used to represent complex concepts that can't easily be described in simple, intuitive terms.\n\n[[virtual particles]] are an example of such a mathematical construct. In the formalism of quantum field theory, virtual particles arise as intermediate states in the calculations of particle interactions. They aren't observable particles in the traditional sense, but rather terms in a mathematical equation.\n\nMore specifically, virtual particles emerge from the [[perturbation theory approximation]] methods used in quantum field theory. When calculating how particles interact, we use [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]] to represent the terms in the series. Each diagram corresponds to a specific mathematical term, and each internal line in the diagram (representing a \"virtual particle\") corresponds to a specific factor in that term.\n\nWhile this might suggest that virtual particles are \"real\" in some sense, it's important to note that they are a part of the mathematical model we use to make accurate predictions. The actual physical interpretation of these mathematical constructs is a topic of ongoing philosophical debate in the physics community. Some physicists interpret them as real transient phenomena, while others view them purely as mathematical tools. The choice of interpretation doesn't affect the predictions of the theory, which have been tested and confirmed to remarkable precision.\n\n\n\nIn [[Quantum Field Theory]] the mathematical equations used to calculate interactions between particles are quite complex. However, the foundation of these calculations is the concept of a propagator. \n\nA propagator is a function that describes the [[probability]] amplitude for a particle to travel from one place to another in a certain time. This is at the heart of the calculations for quantum interactions, and the mathematics of this propagator function is where the concept of [[virtual particles]] emerges.\n\nFor instance, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), the propagator for a [[photon]] is derived from the photon's four-momentum. It is usually represented in terms of the photon's energy and momentum in [[Fourier]] space. The propagator's denominator can become zero, and the points where this happens are referred to as \"poles\". These poles correspond to real particles. However, when one calculates an interaction, one integrates over all possible energies and momenta, not just the real ones. These \"off-shell\" values correspond to virtual particles.\n\nThe actual calculations involve a series of integrals over these propagators and are represented graphically by [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]]. Each line in a [[Feynman diagram]] corresponds to a propagator, and the vertices where they meet represent interaction terms from the quantum field theory's [[Lagrangian]].\n\nIn the case of a simple interaction in QED - for instance, an electron and a positron annihilating to produce a photon which then decays into a different electron-positron pair - the calculation would involve two electron propagators and one photon propagator, as well as factors from the interaction terms. \n\nIt's important to note that these calculations typically involve complex numbers, are done in four-[[dimensional]] [[space-time]], and require a good understanding of quantum mechanics, [[special relativity]], and advanced mathematics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/matter-antimatter asymmetry.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/matter-antimatter asymmetry.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5c59fc83a2ec75836c8546ba864b138561e25174ff025f9ea3fbe7161bcdd7a8", "text": "The matter-antimatter asymmetry during the [[big bang]] is a fascinating topic in cosmology and particle physics. According to our current understanding, the Big Bang should have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the early [[universe]]. However, if that were the case, these matter and antimatter particles would have annihilated each other completely, leaving behind only energy.\n\nThe existence of matter as we observe it today, with no significant amount of antimatter, suggests that there must have been a mechanism or process that led to a slight imbalance between matter and antimatter. This phenomenon is known as baryogenesis.\n\nSeveral theories have been proposed to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. One prominent theory is known as [[strong CP problem|cp-violation]]. It suggests that certain fundamental interactions violate the combined conservation of charge (C) and [[Parity]] (P), leading to a slight preference for matter over antimatter. This violation is observed in certain weak nuclear interactions and has been experimentally confirmed.\n\nAnother theory is related to the concept of leptogenesis, where the imbalance arises from the decay of heavy particles called leptons. These decays could have produced a small excess of matter over antimatter.\n\nWhile these theories provide possible explanations, the exact mechanism behind the matter-antimatter asymmetry is still an active area of research.

These reconfigurations represent rapid transitions between distinct network states or patterns of functional connectivity across different brain regions.  \n\nThe concept of \"metastability\" here refers to the brain's ability to balance between network segregation (each brain region performing its specialized function) and integration (collaboration of different regions for cohesive brain function). Operating at maximum metastability means the brain is constantly shifting, maximizing its flexibility and adaptability. \n\nFurther, the existence of a \"dynamical cortical core\" suggests that there might be specific brain regions that have an outsized influence on these patterns of global brain activity. Identifying these regions and understanding their role in brain function could provide crucial insights into the neural basis of cognition, behavior, and various neurological or psychiatric disorders.\n\nThe use of computational models allows researchers to move beyond simply describing these patterns of activity and towards a more mechanistic understanding of how they emerge from the complex interplay of structural and functional connections in the brain.\n\nThis line of research is part of a broader movement towards understanding the brain from a network perspective, often referred to as connectomics. Given the brain's complexity, these approaches are increasingly seen as essential tools in neuroscience.\n\nThe brain's operation at \"maximum metastability\" as described in the passage you provided has intriguing connections to the concept of \"[[criticality]]\" in brain dynamics. \n\nCriticality refers to the idea that the brain operates at a \"critical\" point situated between two phases - an ordered phase and a disordered phase. In this state, the brain is believed to optimize several computational properties such as information processing, information capacity, and sensitivity to stimuli.\n\nNow, metastability, on the other hand, is the property of a system that is stable, not towards a single state, but around a region in its state space. This is precisely where the brain seems to be during the resting state according to the passage. \n\nIn a state of maximum metastability, the brain doesn't settle into a single pattern of activity, but rather continually shifts between different network states. These network states may represent different functional configurations that the brain can adopt.\n\nThis constant shifting, or switching, of states is indicative of the brain maintaining a balance between integration (bringing information together) and segregation (keeping information separate). This is somewhat similar to the concept of the brain operating at a point of criticality, where it maintains a balance between order (structured, predictable patterns of activity) and chaos (random, unpredictable patterns of activity).\n\n\n\nIn the realm of dynamical systems, it's possible to conceptualize metastable states as being associated with attractors, and specifically with strange attractors in certain circumstances. A [[strange attractor]] in a dynamical system can be considered as a sign that the system might display chaotic behavior, with the system tending to evolve over time within the confines of this attractor.\n\nThe connection of these concepts, however, depends heavily on the specific dynamics of the system. In a high-dimensional system with complex dynamics\u2014such as the brain, for example\u2014it might be possible for the system to exhibit a kind of \"metastable [[chaos theory]],\" where it spends long periods of time in the vicinity of certain strange attractors (metastable states), but with small perturbations leading to transitions between these states. This would yield a kind of dynamic behavior that's both chaotic (due to the influence of the strange attractors) and metastable (due to the tendency of the system to linger near certain states). Such behavior could potentially contribute to the flexibility and adaptability of such a complex system.\n\n[[perturbation theory approximation]] can be particularly useful for studying metastable states. One common approach is to use the unperturbed problem to represent the system in its metastable state and then use perturbation theory to estimate how the system will respond to small external perturbations. This can give insights into how and when the system might transition out of the metastable state.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03073-5\nThis passage discusses the use of computational modeling to investigate the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of brain function. The authors confirm that the brain can be thought of as a system of non-linearly coupled, non-linear oscillatory processes displaying characteristics typical of dynamical systems, including multiple stable states, instability, state transitions, and metastability. This aligns with previous inquiries into the brain's operation at the \"edge of chaos\" or [[criticality]].\n\nThe authors emphasize the concept of metastability, a state of temporary stability before transitioning into a different state. The authors find that the brain, during rest, is \"maximally metastable,\" which could be interpreted as a state of poised readiness, allowing for flexible and swift transitions between functional states.\n\nA major finding of this study is that the optimal operating regime of the brain is at the edge of the local Hopf bifurcation, which is a point at which a system's qualitative behavior changes due to a variation in a bifurcation parameter. This balance of noisy excursions in the oscillatory state may help in achieving the observed metastability.\n\nTo form a heterogeneous brain network model, the authors used spectral information from BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent) data and identified a \"dynamical cortical core\" of the brain. These identified regions have roles in various cognitive processes such as [[memory]] processing, conflict monitoring, and motor execution, and three are part of the default mode network ([[DMN]]), a network active during rest and involved in introspective activities.\n\nThe authors also raise the potential of these models and measurements as potential biomarkers for brain diseases, providing a powerful tool for understanding and diagnosing various neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\"Equally, the involvement of the cingulate cortex is interesting given that this region recently has been shown to be part of the common neurobiological substrate for mental illness across across six diverse diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anxiety)\"\n\nOverall, the authors present a picture of the brain operating in a state of \"maximal metastability,\" able to quickly and flexibly transition between states. This aligns with the concepts of dynamical systems theory, where systems often operate at the boundary between order (stability) and disorder (chaos), a concept known as the \"edge of chaos\" or \"criticality.\" This perspective on brain function might give us valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and cognitive processes, as well as into various disorders of the brain.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/muon g-2 experiment.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/muon g-2 experiment.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "dd1915716e5ce4aeb4325b73dca3ee20376cc654cf2d51b58f4b362036f611d8", "text": "The [[Muon]] g-2 experiment is a fascinating and crucial piece of research in the field of particle physics, probing the very foundations of the [[Standard Model]], which is the best theory we have to describe the behavior of fundamental particles and forces. The experiment focuses on measuring the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon, which is a heavier cousin of the electron.\n\n**The Anomalous Magnetic Dipole Moment:**\nThe magnetic dipole moment of a particle is a measure of its tendency to align with a magnetic field, much like a compass needle aligns with Earth's magnetic field. The \"g-factor\" is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment of a particle in terms of its angular momentum. For particles like electrons and muons, the Dirac equation (from the realm of quantum mechanics and special relativity) predicts that the g-factor should be exactly 2. However, [[quantum fluctuations]] allow these particles to interact with the \"[[quantum foam]],\" the seething mass of [[virtual particles]] that pop in and out of existence due to the uncertainties inherent in quantum mechanics. These interactions slightly alter the g-factor, leading to the so-called anomalous magnetic dipole moment, denoted as \"g-2.\"\n\n**The Experiment:**\nThe Muon g-2 experiment aims to measure this anomaly with extreme precision. The experimental value of the muon's g-2 has been found to differ from the theoretical prediction. This discrepancy, if confirmed, could imply new physics beyond the Standard Model. The theoretical calculations of the muon's g-2 factor are incredibly complex and involve contributions from [[electromagnetism]], the strong force, and the weak force. The most challenging part comes from the strong force, which binds [[quark|quarks]] together inside protons and neutrons and is described by [[QCD|Quantum Chromodynamics]] (QCD).\n\n**Lattice QCD:**\nTo tackle the strong force contributions, physicists use a technique called lattice QCD, which involves simulating QCD on a discrete spacetime lattice. This approach allows for numerical solutions to QCD problems that are otherwise analytically intractable. However, lattice QCD requires immense computational power and is subject to its own uncertainties and approximations.\n\n**Implications of the Results:**\nIf the discrepancy between the experimental measurement and the theoretical prediction persists, it could indicate the presence of unknown particles or forces. This would be a monumental discovery, as it would require an extension or a revision of the Standard Model.\n\n**The Future of the Experiment:**\nResearchers at Fermilab are working to further refine the measurement of the muon's g-2, aiming to reduce the uncertainty to even smaller margins. Meanwhile, theorists are working to refine the calculations, particularly the contributions from the strong force. The hope is that with more precise measurements and calculations, the physics community will be able to determine whether the discrepancy is a sign of new physics or a quirk in the current understanding that can be resolved within the Standard Model framework.\n\nThe excitement around the Muon g-2 experiment is not just about the possibility of discovering new particles or forces. It's also about testing the limits of the Standard Model, which has been remarkably successful but is known to be incomplete. For instance, it doesn't incorporate gravity and doesn't explain dark matter or dark energy. Any hint of new physics could open the door to a deeper understanding of the universe and lead to the development of a more complete theory of fundamental forces and particles.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/muon.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/muon.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "54319fcf109602c1c682318dabc95ca1a4a540b5ce62b4b76453ffaf99ad65fc", "text": "---\naliases:\n  - muons\n---\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/mushrooms.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/mushrooms.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "88406bcbca02d67a7131e241746eb537f974e09f6c718b04c1b90e4b7687e4f3", "text": "[[psychedelics]]\n[[Consciousness]]\n[[Collective Consciousness]]\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/negative energy.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/negative energy.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e61890d4025d1e826d6ab21a1922d17acf9c0de0e095bec3f22219a28f989b56", "text": "quantum mechanics allows you to have negative energy \nNegative energy is a concept that arises in certain areas of physics, particularly in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.

However, it's important to note that negative energy does not imply a deficit of total energy in the system, as energy conservation is still maintained.\nThis is a result of the Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]]: over small timescales, energy conservation can appear to be violated, creating a kind of \"borrowed\" energy that must eventually be paid back, leading to the phenomenon of [[virtual particles]]. It's also worth mentioning that in the context of general relativity, negative energy densities can lead to exotic phenomena like [[einstein-rosen bridges|wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre warp drive]].

It would rather take longer to traverse the wormhole than to travel the regular spacetime distance between the black holes.\n\nAdding to this, Jafferis suggested the idea of a \"negative energy shockwave\" to potentially make the wormhole traversable.

They consist of [[interconnected]] layers of nodes, or \"neurons,\" that perform various mathematical or logical computations. The primary aim of a neural network is to learn a representation of data that's useful for making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for that task.\n\n**1. Biological Inspiration**\n\nThe fundamental building block of a neural network is the [[neuron]], or node. This design is inspired by the neurons in the human brain. Each [[neuron]] takes in a set of inputs, processes them, and produces an output.\n\n**2. Architecture**\n\nIn a neural network, neurons are organized into layers. The simplest kind of neural network contains just three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. More complex, deep neural networks may have multiple hidden layers. These layers are not directly exposed to the input or output, but help in processing the information.\n\n**3. Weights and Biases**\n\nEach connection between neurons has an associated weight, which is adjusted during the learning process. The weight increases the influence of one neuron on another. A bias is an additional parameter which allows the activation of the neuron to be shifted for better fitting the data.\n\n**4. Activation Functions**\n\n[[neurons]] use activation functions to transform the sum of their weighted inputs and biases into an output. Some common activation functions include the sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent function, and rectified linear unit (ReLU).\n\n**5. Training**\n\nNeural networks learn by adjusting their weights and biases based on the error of their predictions. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, which minimizes a defined loss function.\n\n**6. Backpropagation**\n\nBackpropagation is the primary algorithm for performing gradient descent on neural networks. It computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network for a single input\u2013output example, and does so efficiently, unlike a naive direct computation.\n\n**7. Types of Neural Networks**\n\n- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): The information in FNNs only moves in one direction\u2014from the input layer, through the hidden layers, to the output layer.\n  \n- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are used primarily in the field of computer vision, and they\u2019re behind a lot of the exciting advances in deep learning for image recognition.\n  \n- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are designed to make use of sequential data, when the current step has some kind of relationship with the ones before it.\n\n- Long Short-Term [[memory]] Networks (LSTMs): LSTMs are a modification of RNNs which make them more practical to use. LSTMs help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation.\n  \n- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): These are actually two networks, one that generates data and one that tries to discriminate between real and fake data. Through their competition, they can learn to generate very realistic data.\n\n**8. Applications**\n\nNeural networks have a wide variety of applications including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, financial services, health care, recommender systems and more. They are also extensively used in research for advancing [[AI]] capabilities. \n\nWhile this overview touches on the main concepts related to neural networks, each of these topics is a significant field of study in its own right.

For example, alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) are often associated with the inhibition of irrelevant sensory information during attention, while delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) are associated with deep sleep.\n\nNeural oscillations are thought to play an important role in communication and information processing within the brain. [[neural synchronization]] between different brain regions are believed to facilitate communication and the integration of information across different regions.\n\nNeural oscillations play an important role in [[memory]] formation, consolidation, and retrieval. Different types of neural oscillations are associated with different stages of [[memory]] processing. For example, [[Gamma waves|gamma]] oscillations (30-100 Hz) are often seen during the encoding of new information, while [[theta waves|theta]] oscillations (4-8 Hz) are involved in the retrieval of previously learned information.\n\nStudies have shown that manipulating neural oscillations can influence [[memory]] performance. For example, enhancing gamma oscillations through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during encoding has been shown to improve memory recall. Additionally, entraining [[theta waves|theta]] oscillations through rhythmic sensory stimulation has been found to enhance memory consolidation.\n\nOverall, the exact mechanisms by which neural oscillations affect memory are still being studied,[[unknown]] but it is clear that these oscillations play an important role in various aspects of memory processing.\n\n\nBrainwaves are rhythmic or repetitive neural activity in the central nervous system. This neural activity can be measured and visualized using techniques like electroencephalography (EEG). When studying these brainwaves, researchers have noticed that they often exhibit fractal-like patterns. [[fractals]]\n\nThese fractal patterns are thought to reflect the complex, hierarchical organization of [[neural networks]] in the brain. [[neuron]]s are organized into networks, with smaller networks nested within larger networks, much like the branching pattern of a tree or the veins of a leaf. This [[fractal]]-like organization allows the brain to process and integrate information at multiple scales simultaneously.\n\nIn more technical terms, this is referred to as \"scale-free\" or \"1/f\" dynamics, which means that the same patterns of neural activity occur at different scales, or frequencies. This \"1/f\" pattern is a hallmark of fractal or scale-free systems and has been observed in many types of brain activity, from the firing patterns of individual [[neuron|neurons]] to large-scale oscillations measured by EEG.\n\nUnderstanding these [[fractals|fractal]] patterns in neural oscillations could have important implications for understanding how the brain works. For instance, it may be related to the brain's ability to transition smoothly between different states of [[Consciousness]], or to coordinate activity across different regions.

In classical physics, it is possible to make copies of information or physical objects without any limitations. However, in the quantum realm, things are different.\n\nQuantum systems are described by [[wavefunction]]s, which represent the state of the system. The state of a quantum system can be a [[superposition]] of different states, meaning it can exist in multiple states simultaneously. When we attempt to make a copy of a quantum state, we are essentially trying to duplicate this [[superposition]].\n\nThe no-cloning theorem can be mathematically proven using techniques from quantum mechanics. It shows that there is no general unitary transformation that can clone an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. This means that it is not possible to create an exact replica of an arbitrary unknown quantum state without altering it or destroying its original form.\n\n\nEven though it is impossible to make perfect copies of an unknown quantum state, it is possible to produce imperfect copies.

Experiments testing Bell's inequalities support the non-locality of quantum mechanics.\n\n3. **No \"Action at a Distance\":** Even though the phenomena of non-locality may seem to suggest some form of \"action at a distance,\" it is important to note that it doesn't involve a signal passing between the particles. In fact, it can't be used to send information faster than light.\n\n4. **No Impact on Most Experiences:** Non-locality and entanglement don't have much impact on our everyday experiences because these effects are fragile and usually only observable at very small scales or in carefully controlled experimental conditions.\n\n5. **[[Quantum Computing]]:** Non-locality is one of the principles that make quantum computing possible. Quantum bits, or qubits, can be entangled in a way that a change in one [[qubit]] immediately affects the others, enabling faster computation and data processing.\n\n6. **Quantum Teleportation:** While it sounds like science fiction, quantum teleportation is a real process that relies on entanglement and non-locality to transfer the state of a quantum particle to another particle at a distant location.\n\nThe concept of non-locality challenges our intuitive understanding of the world and continues to be a topic of significant research and philosophical debate in the realm of quantum mechanics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/null geodesics.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/null geodesics.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "00030da98a6754b7dfb8a62b362ad2592b18511b63a26e1ea3dfb080d8898795", "text": "Null geodesics are a concept in [[general relativity]] that describe the paths followed by massless particles, such as photons, in [[space-time|spacetime]].

It represents a state where the quantum systems are correlated but not completely. Knowing the state of one system gives some information about the other but doesn't fully determine it. This partial correlation can be due to a variety of reasons. It might occur when the interaction between systems is weaker or influenced by other factors.

But when observed or measured, the system \"collapses\" into one of those possible states. \n\nIn the Penrose Interpretation, this collapse is suggested to happen naturally without the need for an [[observation]]. Penrose proposes that when the difference in space-time curvature caused by the superposed states reaches a significant level, the quantum state will spontaneously localize to a single state.\n\nThis theory is part of what are called \"objective collapse\" theories, which propose that [[wavefunction]] collapse is a physical process and not reliant on [[observation]].\n\nA key aspect of the Penrose Interpretation is its incorporation of [[gravity]] into quantum mechanics. According to Penrose, objects that are in a quantum superposition each create their own distortions in space-time, and these superposed gravitational fields require energy to maintain. The theory postulates that an unstable system tends towards its simplest, lowest-energy state: one object in one location, producing one gravitational field. \n\nSo in this interpretation, gravity essentially forces quantum systems out of superposition and into one state or another. It's gravity that is the \"observer\" causing the collapse, not any conscious observer.\n\nThis theory is speculative and has not been proven.

Penrose's interpretation suggests that each quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature. As the superpositions evolve, these spacetime curvatures would also change, and when they reach a threshold (the aforementioned objective reduction), they would disrupt the quantum state, causing the wave function to collapse to a single state.

The name \"pentaquark\" is derived from the Greek word \"penta\", meaning five, and the word \"quark\", the fundamental building block of protons and neutrons.\n\nThe quark model, proposed independently by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964, posits that protons and neutrons (collectively known as hadrons) are composed of quarks. Initially, only three-quark combinations (baryons, such as protons and neutrons) and quark-antiquark pairs (mesons) were observed.\n\nHowever, [[QCD]] (Quantum Chromodynamics), the theory of strong interactions, doesn't limit the number of quarks in a state, so long as the color charge is neutral. Thus, theoretically, states like pentaquarks, containing more than three quarks, are allowed.\n\nIt wasn't until July 2015 when the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment at CERN reported the discovery of new particles consistent with pentaquarks during the study of the decay of bottom Lambda baryons (\u039bb) that the existence of pentaquarks was finally confirmed. \n\nThe LHCb experiment found that sometimes, when the Lambda baryon decays, the resulting particles pass through an intermediate state in which two quarks and three antiquarks temporarily form a pentaquark. These pentaquarks were named Pc(4450)+ and Pc(4380)+. \n\nThe discovery of pentaquarks provided a new way of arranging quarks, the fundamental constituents of matter, and a new avenue to explore quantum chromodynamics, the theory that describes the [[strong nuclear force]], one of the four fundamental forces of nature.\n\n\ni have a video of me first time drunk in first year physics ranting about pentaquarks!! where is it\n\nquantum resonance could indeed play a role in the dynamics of quark interactions within a pentaquark system, affecting its stability and the likelihood of certain decay channels.

It is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems that involve interactions or forces between particles.\nRayleigh-[[Schr\u00f6dinger]] perturbation theory is a mathematical technique used to approximate the solutions of the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for systems that can be considered as a perturbation of a simpler, exactly solvable system.\n\nIn perturbation theory, the problem is split into a known \"unperturbed\" part and a smaller \"perturbation\" part that accounts for the interactions. The unperturbed part is usually a system or problem that can be solved exactly or for which the solutions are well-known. The perturbation part accounts for the effects that arise from the interactions or forces.\n\nThe idea is to treat the perturbation as a small correction to the unperturbed system and then systematically calculate the corrections to the solution. This is typically done by expanding the solution as a series of terms, where each term represents a higher-order correction. The higher-order terms involve progressively more complicated calculations.\n\nPerturbation theory is particularly successful in quantum mechanics, where it is used to approximate the behavior of particles and systems that are subject to quantum interactions. By treating the interactions as small perturbations to a simpler system, perturbation theory allows for the calculation of various properties and observables.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that perturbation theory is an approximation technique and may not always yield accurate results for strongly interacting systems or in cases where the perturbation is not small. In such cases, more advanced techniques, such as numerical simulations or non-perturbative methods, may be required.\n\nPerturbation theory is particularly useful in cases where the [[Hamiltonian]] of a system can be separated into a solvable part and a smaller perturbation. By treating the perturbation as a small deviation from the solvable part, we can systematically calculate corrections to the energy levels and wavefunctions of the system.\n\nIn practice, perturbation theory is often used to study how a system responds to small perturbations or external influences. It allows us to investigate the effects of interactions, external fields, or other factors that may cause deviations from the idealized systems with known solutions. By expanding the solutions as a series of perturbative corrections, we can approximate the behavior of more complex quantum systems and obtain insights into their properties.\n\nPerturbation theory provides a valuable framework for understanding and analyzing quantum systems beyond the simple cases with exact solutions.

The photoreceptor cells, called rods and cones, contain [[light]]-sensitive molecules called photopigments that undergo a conformational (physical) change upon absorbing a photon. This conformational change leads to a series of biochemical reactions that eventually result in the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse between the photoreceptor and the next cell in the visual pathway, the bipolar cell.\n\nWhen a photon of [[light]] hits a chromophore molecule, it can excite an electron in the molecule from its ground state to a higher energy state ([[quantization]]). This process is called photoexcitation, and it causes a conformational change in the chromophore molecule. This excited state is unstable and quickly relaxes to the ground state by releasing the excess energy as heat or by emitting another photon of lower energy. \n\nIn the case of our vision processing, the excess energy from the photoexcited electron is rapidly released through a series of conformational changes in the protein rhodopsin. These conformational changes ultimately lead to the activation of a signaling cascade, which sends electrical signals to the brain, allowing us to perceive the visual image. Rhodopsin is responsible for our ability to see in low-light conditions, such as at night, as well as our ability to perceive motion.\n\nIn the case of the visual system, the excess energy released during photoexcitation is relatively small, on the order of a few electron volts (eV). The exact amount of excess energy released during photoexcitation depends on the specific chromophore involved and the [[wavelength]] of the incoming photon.\n\nIn the case of the vision process, the amount of energy released upon the electron's return to its lower energy state is directly related to the [[wavelength]] of the photon that was absorbed in the first place. Specifically, the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state of the molecule corresponds to a specific wavelength of light, as determined by the molecule's structure. When a photon of that wavelength is absorbed, the electron in the molecule is excited to its higher energy state. When the electron returns to its ground state, it releases a photon with the same amount of energy as the absorbed photon, and thus the same wavelength. This is what allows us to see colors.\n\nThe neurotransmitters released by the photoreceptor cells bind to receptors on the bipolar cells, generating a graded electrical signal that is then transmitted to other neurons in the retina and ultimately to the brain via the optic nerve. These electrical signals are then sent through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the [[thalamus]], which acts as a relay station for visual information on its way to the visual cortex. So, it is through this pathway that visual information ultimately reaches the [[thalamus]].

This is a property of black holes that occurs at a specific distance from the [[black hole]], dependent on its mass. The photon sphere lies further out than the event horizon, which is the point of no return for falling into a [[black hole]]. \n\nSpecifically, for a non-rotating black hole, the photon sphere is located at 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of the event horizon). At this distance, [[photon]]s moving tangentially (that is, moving perpendicular to the radial line from the center of the black hole) can be captured in a circular orbit around the black hole.\n\nHowever, these photon orbits are unstable. A slight disturbance will cause the photon to either escape from the black hole or fall into the event horizon. This means that while it's theoretically possible for light to orbit a black hole at the photon sphere, in practice such orbits won't last for a long time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the concept of the photon sphere played a key role in creating the first image of a black hole by the Event Horizon Telescope project. The bright ring seen in the image corresponds to the location of the photon sphere, where light paths are bent in a way that they circle around the black hole before reaching us.\n\n\n\nHowever, not all photons that reach the vicinity of a black hole will end up in the photon sphere. The fate of a photon near a black hole will depend on its initial trajectory and energy. Some photons will be captured by the black hole, some will be deflected, and some will end up in unstable orbits around the black hole (in the photon sphere).\n\nIf a photon is in an unstable orbit within the photon sphere and it gets disturbed (for example, by the gravitational influence of another object or particle), it can be ejected from the photon sphere and escape into space. This is how some photons can theoretically travel from the vicinity of a black hole to observers on Earth.\n\nTo visualize this, imagine a photon traveling in a curved path that takes it very close to the black hole but does not cross the event horizon. At its closest approach, the photon is within the photon sphere and its path briefly curves around the black hole before continuing on a trajectory that takes it away from the black hole and eventually to Earth. This is a simplified view, but it illustrates the general idea.\n\nIt's important to note that the above scenarios are based on our current understanding of black holes and general relativity.

Its electric and [[magnetic field]]s undulate with a seductive rhythm, captivating our imaginations and drawing us deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos. Whether it's streaming down from the sun or emanating from distant galaxies, the photon is a tantalizing reminder of the breathtaking beauty and complexity of our universe.\n\nWhen photons from stars reach our eyes, they pass through the cornea and lens and are focused onto the retina. There, they are absorbed by specialized cells called rods and cones, which convert the photons into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain then interprets these signals as the images that we perceive. So in a sense, the photons from stars are responsible for creating the visual experience of the night sky that we all enjoy.\n\nWhen photons hit our eyes it undergoes [[photoexcitation]]\n\nPhotons mediate the electromagnetic force, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The [[electromagnetic force]] is responsible for electric and magnetic interactions between charged particles. Photons are the carriers of this force, and they allow charged particles to interact with one another by exchanging photons. When a charged particle emits or absorbs a photon, it gains or loses energy and changes its momentum. This interaction is the basis of many physical phenomena, including [[light]], electricity, and magnetism.\n\nIn physics, [[energy]] is defined as the capacity to do work. Light is a form of energy that is generated by the motion of charged particles. When charged particles move, they create electromagnetic waves, and light is one type of electromagnetic wave. So, in this sense, light is generated by the motion of charged particles.\n\nIn the case of photons, which are particles of light, their energy is directly proportional to their frequency (or inversely proportional to their [[wavelength]]), according to the equation E=hf, where E is energy, h is [[Planck's constant]], and f is frequency. Therefore, measuring the energy of a photon with high precision would require measuring its frequency with high precision.\n\nHowever, since photons are massless and travel at the speed of light, they have a dual nature and can also be described as waves. This means that photons do not have a well-defined position in [[space-time]], which further complicates the measurement of their energy and time of measurement. Therefore, the [[Energy Time Uncertainty Principle]] places a fundamental limit on our ability to measure both the energy and time of a photon simultaneously. \n\nIn the wave description, light is [[manifested]] through oscillating electric and [[magnetic field]]s that propagate through space.

This theory provides an alternative perspective on the behavior of quantum particles and offers a [[deterministic]] description of quantum phenomena. \n\nIn the de Broglie-Bohm theory, particles are considered to have both particle-like properties and wave-like properties. The theory introduces the concept of a \"pilot wave\" that guides the motion of particles. The pilot wave is a real physical field that interacts with the particles and determines their behavior.\n\nKey aspects of the de Broglie-Bohm theory include:\n\n1. Determinism: Unlike the [[probability|probabilistic]] nature of standard quantum mechanics, the de Broglie-Bohm theory is [[deterministic]]. It posits that the particles have well-defined positions and velocities at all times, even when they are not being measured.\n\n2. Particle and Wave Nature: According to the theory, particles have definite positions and trajectories, similar to classical particles. However, they are also associated with a wave function that evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. The wave function provides information about the [[probability|probabilities]] of particle positions.\n\n3. Pilot Wave: The pilot wave is a guiding field that determines the behavior of the particles. It is defined by the wave function and interacts with the particles to influence their motion. The pilot wave propagates in a manner consistent with the wave equation of standard quantum mechanics.\n\n4. [[non-locality]]: The de Broglie-Bohm theory allows for [[non-locality|non-local]] effects, where the behavior of a particle at one location can be influenced by the position of another particle instantaneously. This [[non-locality]] is a consequence of the pilot wave's influence on the particles.\n\n5. Measurement and Wave Collapse: In the de Broglie-Bohm theory, wave collapse does not occur as a result of measurement. Instead, the collapse of the wave function is a manifestation of the interaction between the particle and the pilot wave.\n\nWhile the de Broglie-Bohm theory offers a [[deterministic]] and intuitive interpretation of quantum mechanics, it is not widely accepted as the standard interpretation. This is partly due to the challenges in reconciling the theory with certain experimental results and the conceptual difficulties associated with [[non-locality]]. Nonetheless, the de Broglie-Bohm theory provides an intriguing alternative perspective on the underlying mechanics of quantum phenomena.\n\nPilot-wave theory is a theoretical framework that can be used to explain some of the results from [[Wheeler]] [[delayed choice experiment]]s. \nIn a delayed choice experiment, a photon or electron is sent through a double-slit setup and its behavior is observed at a later time. The pilot-wave theory suggests that the wave function of the particle is affected by the measurement apparatus that is ultimately used to observe it, even if that apparatus is not present at the time when the particle passes through the double-slit.\nThis theory can help to explain some of the strange and seemingly paradoxical results that have been observed in delayed choice experiments, such as the fact that the particle can be observed as both a wave and a particle depending on the measurement apparatus used. However, it is important to note that pilot-wave theory is not the only theoretical framework that can be used to explain these results, and there is ongoing debate and research in the field of quantum mechanics regarding the best way to interpret and understand these experiments.\nmaybe? idk\n\n\nBut some 27 years after Bohm had published his interpretation of quantum theory, interest was rekindled in part\u00a0by new, detailed calculations that demonstrated clearly and graphically, exactly how his interpretation explained quantum phenomena in terms of well defined individual particle trajectories. These computations encompassed two-slit [[interference]], [[quantum tunnelling]], neutron interferometry, [[Wheeler]]\u2019s delayed choice experiment, orbital and intrinsic angular momentum, quantum measurement and Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen nonlocal correlations for orbital angular momentum, intrinsic angular momentum and correlated particle interferometry.\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-022-00655-w\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2014/06/the-new-quantum-reality/\nThe experiments began a decade ago, when\u00a0Yves Couder\u00a0and colleagues at Paris Diderot University discovered that vibrating a silicon oil bath up and down at a particular frequency can induce a droplet to bounce along the surface. The droplet\u2019s path, they found, was guided by the slanted contours of the liquid\u2019s surface generated from the droplet\u2019s own bounces \u2014 a mutual particle-wave interaction analogous to de Broglie\u2019s pilot-wave concept.\n\nIn a\u00a0groundbreaking experiment, the Paris researchers used the droplet setup to demonstrate single- and double-slit interference. They discovered that when a droplet bounces toward a pair of openings in a damlike barrier, it passes through only one slit or the other, while the pilot wave passes through both. Repeated trials show that the overlapping wavefronts of the pilot wave steer the droplets to certain places and never to locations in between \u2014 an apparent replication of the interference pattern in the quantum double-slit experiment that Feynman described as \u201cimpossible \u2026 to explain in any classical way.\u201d And just as measuring the trajectories of particles seems to \u201ccollapse\u201d their simultaneous realities, disturbing the pilot wave in the bouncing-droplet experiment destroys the interference pattern.\n\nIn its current, immature state, the pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics only describes simple interactions between matter and electromagnetic fields, according toDavid Wallace, a philosopher of physics at the University of Oxford in England, and cannot even capture the physics of an ordinary light bulb. \u201cIt is not by itself capable of representing very much physics,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIn my own view, this is the most severe problem for the theory, though, to be fair, it remains an active research area.\u201d\n\nPilot-wave theory has the reputation of being more cumbersome than standard quantum mechanics. Some researchers said that the theory has trouble dealing with identical particles, and that it becomes unwieldy when describing multiparticle interactions. They also claimed that it combines less elegantly with special relativity. But other specialists in quantum mechanics disagreed or said the approach is simply under-researched. It may just be a matter of effort to recast the predictions of quantum mechanics in the pilot-wave language, said\u00a0Anthony Leggett, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a Nobel laureate. \u201cWhether one thinks this is worth a lot of time and effort is a matter of personal taste,\u201d he added. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/pineal gland.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/pineal gland.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "743d724de31fd22d01a3f4bea8d6abe68ccc662ad6c1dae4d93a3b48d64f7d13", "text": "The pineal gland, which contains light-sensitive photoreceptor cells, plays important roles in the regulation of circadian rhythms in animal behavior and physiology. \nIn zebrafish, the pineal gland develops during early embryonic stages [3].

Circular polarization can also be seen as a combination of two perpendicular linearly polarized waves with the same amplitude but a phase difference.\n\n3. Elliptical polarization: Elliptically polarized waves have electric field vectors that trace out an elliptical path as the wave propagates.

It was initially expected that the spin of the proton would be the sum of the spins of these three quarks. However, experiments in the 1980s called deep inelastic scattering experiments showed that this is not the case. The experiments indicated that the spins of the three valence quarks contribute only a small fraction to the total spin of the proton.\n\nThis result was unexpected and caused what is known as the \"proton spin crisis.\" It implied that there must be other components of the proton contributing to its spin. Subsequent research has shown that the [[gluon|gluons]] (which mediate the [[strong nuclear force]] binding the quarks) and the [[stream|sea]] of [[virtual particles]] quark-antiquark pairs inside the proton also contribute to the proton's spin, but the exact distribution of the spin amongst these components is still an active area of research.

An intriguing aspect of this theory is that it suggests that a proton is not just composed of three quarks, but it's also filled with what are known as [[virtual particles]]. These virtual particles, consisting mostly of quark-antiquark pairs and gluons, are a phenomenon arising from [[quantum fluctuations]], constantly flickering in and out of existence within the proton.

This multitude of transient particles populating the proton contributes to its complex internal structure.\n\nThese virtual particles form a \"sea\" that permeates the proton. While the three \"valence\" quarks (the two up quarks and one down quark) define the proton's basic properties, the sea quarks contribute to the proton's mass and charge distributions. Interactions between the valence quarks and the sea quarks can affect the proton's structure and behavior. The quantum properties of charge, spin and momentum must be conserved with the proton sea there is order within this chaos. \n\nFurthermore, high-energy experiments have shown that the proton's [[spin]] cannot be accounted for by the spins of the three valence quarks alone.

Entropy is applied here in the context of states of [[Consciousness]] and their associated neurodynamics, with a particular focus on the psychedelic state. The psychedelic state is considered an exemplar of a primitive or primary state of consciousness that preceded the development of modern, adult, human, normal waking consciousness. Based on neuroimaging data with psilocybin, a classic psychedelic drug, it is argued that the defining feature of \u201cprimary states\u201d is elevated entropy in certain aspects of brain function, such as the repertoire of functional [[Connectivity]] motifs that form and fragment across time. Indeed, since there is a greater repertoire of connectivity motifs in the psychedelic state than in normal waking consciousness, this implies that primary states may exhibit \u201c[[criticality]],\u201d i.e., the property of being poised at a \u201ccritical\u201d point in a transition zone between order and disorder where certain phenomena such as power-law scaling appear.\"\n\nThe key concept here is [[entropy]], a measure of randomness or disorder. In the context of the brain, entropy refers to the randomness or unpredictability of brain activity.\nIn this view, the brain at rest \u2014 normal waking consciousness \u2014 is said to be in a state of low entropy: its activity is fairly predictable, and it settles into a limited set of [[patterns]] (or \"functional connectivity motifs,\" as you put it). The suggestion is that during a psychedelic experience, the entropy of brain activity increases: the brain's activity becomes more random, and it explores a broader set of patterns. This increased randomness or variability in brain activity is thought to correlate with the richness and diversity of conscious experiences during the psychedelic state.\nThe idea of \"criticality\" you mentioned is that the brain operates in a zone that is neither too ordered nor too chaotic. At this \"critical\" point, the brain can transition easily between different patterns of activity, which might facilitate things like perception, learning, and adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During the psychedelic state, the electrical activity of the brain is less predictable and less \u2018integrated\u2019 than during normal conscious wakefulness \u2013 as measured by global signal diversity. \u201cSince this measure has already shown its value as a measure of \u2018conscious level\u2019, we can say that the psychedelic state appears as a higher \u2018level\u2019 of consciousness than normal, but only with respect to this specific mathematical measure.\u201d\"\n\nThis is a fascinating assertion, one that could add a lot to our understanding of consciousness. The quote appears to refer to studies that have used measures of diversity in brain signals - such as Lempel-Ziv complexity or other entropy-based measures - to quantify the richness or unpredictability of brain activity. This could be measured using EEG, MEG, or fMRI data, among others.\n\nIn this case, a higher level of signal diversity is interpreted as a higher level of consciousness. From an information-theoretic point of view, a system that is capable of a wider range of states or configurations - i.e., one with higher entropy - is processing more information and could thus be seen as having a higher level of consciousness.\n\nAs far as psychedelics are concerned, the research suggests that these substances cause a kind of \"network explosion\" where the normal communication pathways in the brain are disrupted, leading to a state of unconstrained cognition. This \"freed\" state could potentially facilitate the brain's ability to enter new states of consciousness, hence the assertion that the psychedelic state is a higher level of consciousness in terms of global signal diversity.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/quanta.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/quanta.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "56677390bf462b565ac2d905c85f7e65476607d0eec1dcb466e62337c316e3b1", "text": "Quanta, in the context of physics, refers to [[discrete]] units or packets of energy.

According to quantum mechanics, particles such as photons (particles of light) and electrons can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. Quanta, in this context, can be thought of as the discrete packets of energy associated with particles.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of quanta is the [[photon]]. Photons are particles of light that exhibit [[quantization|quantized]] energy. The energy of a single photon is directly proportional to its frequency (or inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]]) according to the equation E = hf, where E is the energy, h is [[Planck]]'s constant, and f is the frequency.

These quantum processes could allow for a type of [[non-locality|non-local]], unified experience that we perceive as [[Consciousness]]. The theory further suggests that consciousness can shift within the [[fractals|fractal]] hierarchy, a concept similar to the musical changes across octaves.\n\nPhysicist Giuseppe Vitiello, on the other hand, uses the metaphor of a magnet to describe the transition from chaotic quantum states to ordered macroscopic ones in the brain, a phenomenon known as quantum [[coherence]]. He posits that this is the core process behind the brain's fractal operations.\n\nMeanwhile, philosopher Carey Welch proposes that [[Consciousness]] is a temporal [[fractal]]. She argues that our perception of time is not a linear progression but a layered, fractal experience. She explains how the brainwaves of infants (dominated by slow delta waves) keep them primarily in the present moment. As we age and our brainwaves shift from [[theta waves|theta]] to alpha to beta, our perception of time also changes, getting divided into smaller and smaller increments. \n\n\n\n\"We can conclude that consciousness is a quantum mechanical entity that can have an independent existence. It can localize in the human brain when the electron is in a particle state. This provides the necessary quantum mechanical base conducive for it to interact with and function in the brain. When the state changes to that of a wave, consciousness takes flight and starts floating. It takes away with it at least a part of the contents of the [[memory]]. It possesses the ability to acquire visual, auditory and olfactory information in spite of the fact that there are no sense organs associated with it. This information is produced by the consciousness projection of a different reality caused by the change in state of the electron, which one may interpret later as a dream or hallucination that comes from an altered perception of reality.\"\nFrom\u00a0Quantum Physics in Consciousness Studies\n\n\nThe emergence of quantum technologies has provided new insights and perspectives into the study of consciousness. These technologies enable us to delve into the interactions of micro particles in the universe, suggesting that all entities are non-locally interconnected across time and space due to quantum entanglement.\n\nBy examining the functions of cellular and nervous systems in living organisms, and analyzing the influence of quantum theories on consciousness, several propositions emerge:\n\n1. Quantum Entanglement in Biological Systems: It is proposed that there is a presence of quantum entanglement in biological organisms. This suggests that certain biological processes may potentially be influenced or even governed by quantum phenomena.\n\n2. Biological Electricity and Consciousness: The phenomenon of bioelectricity \u2013 the generation and transmission of electric currents in biological organisms \u2013 is deeply linked with consciousness. The electrical activity in our brains, for instance, is closely tied with our conscious experiences.\n\n3. Consciousness in Living and Non-Living Entities: The proposition is put forth that both living organisms and non-living entities possess a form of consciousness. However, different entities, based on their composition and functionality, exhibit varying degrees of consciousness.\n\n4. Influence of Consciousness on Quantum Phenomena: The strong and weak of thinking consciousness influences the fluctuation of quantum and the size of quantum entanglement degree. This suggests that our conscious thoughts could have tangible effects on the physical world.\n\n5. Quantum Fluctuations and Consciousness: It's suggested that quantum fluctuations, in turn, also impact the consciousness of living and non-living entities. This implies a two-way interaction between consciousness and quantum phenomena.\n\n6. Interconnectedness through [[Quantum Entanglement]]: The integration of quantum [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] technology with conscious thought could potentially establish an [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] between human beings and the universe.\n\n7. Consciousness and Quantum [[observation]]: There's a possibility that [[Consciousness]] might influence the outcomes of quantum measurements. This links to the [[observation|observer]] effect, a key concept in quantum mechanics.\n\n8. Coexistence of Quantum and Classical Physics: In our day-to-day lives, we primarily use the laws of classical physics.

It is used to describe the nature of the universe at the [[Planck]] scale, which is the smallest possible length (around 10^-35 meters). \n\nAccording to this hypothesis, at the [[Planck]] scale, the fabric of spacetime is not smooth and continuous, but instead is turbulent and fluctuating. It's comparable to the surface of boiling water appearing smooth from a distance, but when viewed up close, it's a frothing mass of bubbles and steam.\n\nThe quantum foam model suggests that these tiny, momentary fluctuations in the fabric of spacetime are causing minuscule, transient [[black hole|black holes]] and wormholes to form and evaporate almost instantly. This is due to Heisenberg's [[uncertainty principle]], which implies that the more precisely one property (like position) is known, the less precisely other properties (like momentum or energy) can be known. In this context, the \"foam\" is actually tiny pairs of particles and [[antiparticles]], spontaneously forming and annihilating in tiny fractions of a second. \n\nIt's also worth noting that quantum foam may not be merely a [[stream|sea]] of [[virtual particles]], but also a froth of tiny, ephemeral black holes and wormholes, coming in and out of existence at an incredibly rapid rate. This speculation arises from the consideration of gravitational effects at the [[Planck]] scale.\n\nTheories such as [[loop quantum gravity]] and [[String theory]] offer different perspectives on the nature of the universe at these scales.\n\nThe most direct application of the quantum foam concept is in theories of quantum gravity. In classical general relativity, spacetime is a smooth manifold. However, quantum foam suggests that this smoothness breaks down at the Planck scale, where quantum fluctuations in the geometry of spacetime become significant. This could be a clue for theorists working on a unified theory of quantum gravity, potentially influencing approaches like loop quantum gravity or string theory.\n\nThe idea of quantum foam has been used to explore the properties of black holes, particularly in the context of Hawking radiation and black hole entropy. If spacetime is \"foamy\" at small scales, then this could have implications for how information interacts with black holes, potentially providing insights into the black hole information paradox.\n\nQuantum foam could have implications for the early universe, particularly during the era of cosmic inflation. If spacetime is subject to quantum fluctuations, these could be \"stretched\" by the rapid expansion of the universe, leaving an imprint that might be observable in the cosmic microwave background or other cosmological data.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/quantum geometry.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/quantum geometry.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3936bccfbd666003b4d3dc4916d465cf4afdc12e7d242e19fe847163a6805d1a", "text": "Quantum geometry is a concept used in various theories of quantum gravity to describe the modification, alteration, or quantization of the fabric of spacetime itself due to quantum effects. The usage of the term varies among theories, reflecting the distinct ways they incorporate quantum properties into the structure of spacetime.\n\nIn string theory, \"quantum geometry\" refers to the peculiar phenomena, such as T-duality, mirror symmetry, topology-changing transitions, the existence of a minimal possible distance scale, and other effects that contradict classical geometric intuition. These result from the theory's unique treatment of spacetime as being fundamentally composed of tiny, one-dimensional strings. The term also refers to the effects of quantum corrections to the metric tensor, which defines the shape of spacetime as seen by D-branes.\n\nIn contrast, \"quantum geometry\" in loop quantum gravity (LQG) typically refers to a specific formalism where geometric properties of spacetime, such as area or volume, are treated as quantized, or discrete, values. This results from representing these geometric observables as operators in a quantum mechanical Hilbert space. This means that, instead of having a smooth range of possible values as in classical geometry, these quantities have a spectrum of discrete, or \"quantized,\" values. Furthermore, it has been shown that the geometry in LQG is non-commutative, a fundamentally quantum property that indicates the order of operations matters.\n\nLastly, another approach, known as Discrete Lorentzian quantum gravity, aims to reconstruct spacetime geometry from \"first principles,\" positing that spacetime is discrete at the smallest scales.\n\nNow, connecting these ideas with [[implicate and explicate order]], in the framework of quantum gravity theories such as loop quantum gravity or string theory, the very fabric of spacetime is subject to quantum effects. The spacetime is not a passive stage on which events play out, but is a dynamic, evolving entity, influenced by and influencing the events it hosts.\n\nIn this picture, the quantum geometry of spacetime at the Planck scale could be seen as an implicate order. This quantum geometry is an undivided whole, a web of relationships rather than isolated points. It is from this quantum geometry that the classical spacetime of general relativity - the smooth, curved manifold where objects move along geodesics - emerges, or \"explicates.\"\n\nBohm's implicate order also involves a constantly unfolding and enfolding process, a constant flow and change. This is reminiscent of the dynamical nature of spacetime in quantum gravity, where spacetime is not a static entity but is subject to quantum fluctuations.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/quantum gravitational field.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/quantum gravitational field.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/quantum gravity.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/quantum gravity.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "02e3923f79088e10fb90faeb9a130ae0853e4da1725ef9a426a2d4194b54543a", "text": "to explore quantum gravity physicists use [[holographic duality]] which mathematically connects gravitational systems to quantum systems \nhttps://aeon.co/videos/the-tangled-tale-of-how-physicists-built-a-groundbreaking-wormhole-in-a-lab\n\n\nTheories to absolve quantum gravity: \n1. **String theory:** This proposes that the fundamental constituents of reality are one-dimensional strings rather than point-like particles. These strings can vibrate at different frequencies, and the vibrational modes are thought to give rise to all particle types and forces, including gravity.\n    \n2. **Loop quantum gravity (LQG):** This is a theory that attempts to quantize the geometry of spacetime itself.

In standard quantum mechanics, the act of observing a quantum system is said to \"collapse\" the system from a superposition of many possible states into one definite state. Penrose suggested that this collapse might happen spontaneously without the need for an observer, due to [[gravity]]. Specifically, when a quantum system becomes too large (in a certain sense), it spontaneously collapses to a single state. He further hypothesized that this process could be related to [[Consciousness]].\n\nIn the realm of general relativity and quantum gravity, Penrose is best known for his work on black holes and the Big Bang. He showed that at the heart of every [[black hole]] lies a [[singularity]], a point where densities become infinite and our understanding of physics breaks down. This led him to propose the idea of a \"[[cosmic censorship hypothesis]]\", which postulates that all singularities are hidden from view, or \"censored\", within black holes. He also worked with Stephen Hawking to develop the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems, which demonstrated that under certain conditions, general relativity predicts the formation of singularities - this was a major factor in convincing physicists that the Big Bang likely started with a singularity.\n\nMore recently, Penrose has proposed a cosmological model known as \"[[Conformal Cyclic Cosmology]]\" (CCC). In CCC, the universe undergoes an infinite sequence of \"aeons\", each beginning with a Big Bang and ending in a smooth, empty, \"de Sitter\" universe. This universe then transitions to the next aeon in the sequence. While CCC is not widely accepted, it is a good example of Penrose's unique approach to these difficult problems.\n\nAs of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, the specifics of quantum gravity, including how to properly combine quantum mechanics and gravity, remain open questions in theoretical physics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/quantum harmonic oscillator.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/quantum harmonic oscillator.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "46aed1b840261d64bbc185ca06b532a03cc755ad6489d2e5a793bf2273be72f7", "text": "The\u00a0Quantum Harmonic Oscillator\u00a0\n\nEn\u00a0= (n-1/2)\u00a0\u045b\u03c9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 n=1, 2, 3, ...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe ground state energy of the quantum harmonic oscillator is E0\u00a0=\u00a0\u045b\u03c9/2.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe node spacing and the amplitude both increase as the particle moves away from the equilibrium positions at x=0. the particle slows down as it moves away from the origin causing its deBroglie wavelength and the [[probability]] of finding it increases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEvib\u00a0= (n-1/2)\u00a0\u045b\u03c9\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe energy levels calculated by the above equation are called the vibrational energy levels.\n\n1.

In [[Quantum Computing]], however, information is represented by quantum bits or qubits, which can be in a [[superposition]] of 0 and 1 simultaneously. This enables quantum computers to perform computations on multiple states at once, leading to an exponential increase in processing power for some tasks.\n\nOne of the key phenomena studied in quantum information theory is [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]], where particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle is directly related to the state of another, regardless of distance. This property has significant implications for areas such as quantum communication and cryptography.\n\nQuantum operations and gates manipulate qubits according to the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical logic gates, quantum gates must adhere to certain constraints, such as preserving unitarity. [[Quantum Gates]] are the building blocks of quantum algorithms and play a critical role in quantum computing.\n\nQuantum communication studies how information can be transferred using quantum principles. For example, quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution (QKD) are methods that rely on quantum entanglement to transmit information securely. Quantum communication provides a means to achieve tasks that would be impossible using classical methods alone.\n\nA major challenge in quantum information processing is dealing with noise and [[decoherence]]. [[Quantum Error Correction]] is a set of techniques developed to detect and correct errors in quantum systems without disturbing the information being processed.

Notable examples include [[Shor's algorithm]] for factoring large numbers and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases. These algorithms can provide significant efficiency gains over classical methods for certain problems.\n\nQuantum cryptography applies quantum mechanics to create secure communication channels. Since measuring a quantum system changes its state, any eavesdropping attempts would be detectable. This makes quantum cryptography a promising method for secure communication.\n\nQuantum complexity theory categorizes problems based on the resources required for quantum computations. This helps to identify which problems are suitable for quantum computing.\n\nVarious mathematical tools are used to quantify entanglement in quantum systems, such as entanglement of formation, concurrence, and [[von Neumann entropy]]. These measures are important for understanding and manipulating entanglement in quantum information processing.\n\nFinally, [[quantum channels]] describe how quantum states change during transmission, including noise and loss. Understanding these channels is essential for designing robust quantum communication systems.\n\nOverall, quantum information theory is a multifaceted field that delves into the unique aspects of quantum systems and their applications in information processing.

The concept of [[quantization]], which is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, states that certain properties, such as energy, are restricted to [[discrete]], quantized values rather than being continuous.\n\n[[electrons]] in an atom can occupy specific energy levels, which are characterized by their distinct energy values. These energy levels are quantized, meaning that only certain discrete values are allowed. The electron can exist in one of these energy levels, and the energy difference between them corresponds to specific amounts of energy.\n\nDuring a quantum leap, an electron undergoes an abrupt transition from one energy level to another, either higher or lower. This transition is instantaneous and occurs when the electron gains or loses energy. When an electron moves to a lower energy level, it releases energy in the form of a [[photon]], which carries away the excess energy. Conversely, when an electron jumps to a higher energy level, it absorbs energy from its surroundings, often in the form of a photon.\n\nThe concept of quantum leaps challenges the classical notion of a continuous and smooth transition between energy states. Instead, it highlights the discrete nature of energy levels and the discontinuous behavior of electrons in the quantum realm. Quantum leaps play a crucial role in phenomena such as emission and absorption of [[light]], the behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules, and the understanding of atomic spectra and electronic transitions.\n\nThe occurrence of quantum leaps in quantum systems is probabilistic rather than [[deterministic]], which means that it involves an inherent element of [[random]]ness. According to quantum mechanics, the exact timing and outcome of a quantum leap cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nWhen an electron transitions between energy levels, the specific moment at which the transition occurs and the resulting energy level it jumps to are determined by [[probability|probabilities]]. These probabilities are described by mathematical equations, such as wave functions, which provide the likelihood of different outcomes.\n\nThe randomness in quantum leaps is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and is related to the [[wave-particle duality]] of quantum particles. It arises from the inherent uncertainty associated with measuring and predicting the behavior of quantum systems.\n\nIt's important to note that while the timing and outcome of individual quantum leaps may appear random, [[statistical patterns]] emerge when considering a large number of quantum systems. This allows scientists to make probabilistic predictions and describe the overall behavior of quantum systems at a macroscopic level, even if individual events appear random.\n\nquantum leaps describe the abrupt transitions of electrons between quantized energy levels, while [[photoexcitation]] is a specific type of quantum leap that occurs through the absorption of [[photon]]s, leading to the elevation of electrons to higher energy levels.

Bose-Einstein condensates are states of matter that occur when particles known as bosons are cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero. At these extremely low temperatures, the particles occupy the same quantum state and can be described by the same wave function, effectively behaving as a single quantum entity. This state of matter was predicted by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in the early 20th century and was first created in a laboratory in 1995.\n\nIn a BEC, particles move in unison and exhibit collective properties that are typically only observable at the quantum scale, such as superfluidity, where the fluid has zero viscosity and can flow without losing energy. The fact that plants might be using a similar process at room temperature to enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis is a testament to the sophistication of natural systems.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, storing it in the bonds of sugar molecules. It is a complex process that involves the absorption of light by chlorophyll, the excitation of electrons, and a series of reactions that ultimately convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The efficiency of this process is crucial for the survival of the plant, as it determines how effectively it can harness energy from the sun.\n\nThe study from the University of Chicago suggests that during photosynthesis, certain quantum mechanical processes allow for the formation of excitons, which are pairs of electrons and holes that act together as bosons. These excitons can move energy efficiently within the plant cell, behaving similarly to particles in a BEC. The idea that these exciton condensates can form and persist at ambient temperatures challenges our current understanding of such states, which were previously thought to only exist at extremely low temperatures.\n\nThe implications of this discovery are profound. If plants can indeed create and maintain a BEC-like state at normal temperatures, it could revolutionize our approach to developing new technologies that mimic this process. We could see advancements in energy transfer and storage, leading to more efficient solar cells, sensors, and other devices that utilize quantum properties for enhanced performance. Additionally, understanding this process could lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of quantum coherence and decoherence, which are central to the development of quantum computing and other quantum technologies.\n\nThe potential for room-temperature BECs to impact various fields is significant. In quantum computing, for instance, maintaining quantum coherence at higher temperatures would address one of the major challenges in the development of practical quantum computers. In metrology, BECs could lead to the development of more precise measurements of time, gravity, and magnetic fields. The applications in energy efficiency and transfer could also contribute to more sustainable technologies, which is particularly relevant in the context of global efforts to address climate change and energy consumption.\n\nIn summary, the discovery that plants may utilize quantum mechanical processes akin to those in a Bose-Einstein condensate at normal temperatures is a groundbreaking finding that could have wide-ranging implications across multiple scientific disciplines and technologies.

The [[wavefunction]], a complex-valued function, carries the complete information about the system. The [[probability]] density associated with a particle in space is given by the absolute square of its [[wavefunction]].\n\nQuantum tunnelling refers to the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a particle tunnels through a barrier that it classically could not surmount. A quantum particle can penetrate through the energy barrier U0\u00a0at an exponentially decreasing rate. The wave function decreases within the barrier but hasn\u2019t vanished when it reaches the other side. There is some probability that the particle can pass through classical barrier and through to the other side. The probability is reduced but not the energy. The probability that\u00a0 a particle striking the barrier from the left will emerge on the right is:\u00a0\n\n$$P(tunnel)\u00a0= |AR|^2/|AL|^2\u00a0= (e^(-w/\u0273))2\u00a0=\u00a0e^(-2w/\u0273)$$\n\n!\n\nWhen a particle with energy E encounters a potential barrier of height V (E < V), classical mechanics predicts that the particle will always be reflected, as it lacks the necessary energy to overcome the barrier. However, in quantum mechanics, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] predicts that the [[wavefunction]], while attenuating, continues through the barrier. This leads to a non-zero [[probability]] of finding the particle on the other side of the barrier, even though its energy is insufficient to overcome the barrier classically. This is quantum tunneling.\n\nQuantum tunneling has noticeable effects on the microscopic scale. Here are a few key instances:\n\n1. **Radioactive decay**: Quantum tunneling is the key mechanism behind alpha decay, a form of radioactive decay. The alpha particle inside a nucleus tunnels out of the nuclear potential well against a prohibitive potential barrier.\n\n2. **Fusion in the Sun**: Protons in the sun don't have enough energy to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them. They manage to get close enough to each other for the [[strong nuclear force]] to act, thereby enabling fusion, by tunneling through the electrostatic barrier.\n\n3. **Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM)**: The STM, an instrument used for imaging surfaces at the atomic level, operates on the principle of quantum tunneling. It involves a sharp metallic tip brought close to a conductive surface, with a small bias voltage applied between them. The resulting current, owing to electrons tunneling across the barrier, is extremely sensitive to the tip position, which enables STM to achieve atomic resolution.\n\n4.

It is a state in which quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental particles that make up protons, neutrons, and other hadrons, are no longer confined within individual particles but are instead liberated and move freely.\n\nIn normal conditions, quarks and gluons are bound together by the [[strong nuclear force]] and are confined within hadrons. However, at extremely high temperatures and densities, such as those present in the [[early universe]] or in high-energy particle collisions, the binding force between quarks and gluons weakens, leading to the creation of a plasma-like state.\n\nThe formation of QGP requires temperatures on the order of several trillion degrees Celsius, which is much higher than what can be achieved in typical laboratory settings. To create such extreme conditions, scientists use particle colliders like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where heavy ions (such as gold or lead nuclei) are accelerated to high speeds and made to collide.\n\nDuring these collisions, the tremendous energy densities and temperatures cause the protons and neutrons in the colliding nuclei to melt, releasing their constituent quarks and gluons. The resulting QGP lasts for a very short time, typically on the order of microseconds, before it cools and undergoes a process called hadronization, where the liberated quarks and gluons recombine to form the familiar [[hadrons]].\n\nThe study of QGP provides insights into the fundamental properties of the [[strong nuclear force]] and the behavior of matter at extreme conditions. It helps scientists understand the [[early universe]] and the evolution of matter in the first microseconds after the Big Bang. Additionally, QGP research has implications for high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and the study of the quark-gluon structure of [[hadrons]].\n\nExperimental observations and measurements of various properties of the QGP, such as its temperature, pressure, and collective behavior, are achieved through the analysis of the particles produced in heavy-ion collisions.

They are a type of fermion, which means they follow the rules of quantum mechanics and obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which are the particles that make up the atomic nucleus.\n\nThere are six known types, or flavors, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Each quark flavor has a corresponding [[antiparticles|antiparticle]] with opposite charge and quantum properties. Quarks are never found alone in nature due to a phenomenon called [[confinement]]. Instead, they are always bound together in groups of two or three, forming composite particles called [[hadrons]].\n\nQuarks have fractional electric charges. The up quark and the charm quark have a charge of +2/3, while the down quark and the strange quark have a charge of -1/3. The top quark has a charge of +2/3, and the bottom quark has a charge of -1/3. The combination of quarks with different charges allows for the formation of particles with different electric charges and other properties.\n\nQuarks interact through the [[strong nuclear force]], which is responsible for holding atomic nuclei together. They also interact through the [[weak nuclear force]] and [[electromagnetism]]. The strong force is mediated by particles called [[gluon]]s, which bind quarks together within hadrons.\n\nQuarks are characterized by a property called color charge, which is unrelated to the visual perception of color. The color charge allows quarks to interact through the strong force, and it comes in three possible values: red, green, and blue. Quarks can combine in such a way that the resulting combination is color-neutral, which is why protons and neutrons are stable despite containing quarks with different colors.\n\nThe study of quarks and their interactions is a major focus of particle physics.

It's not a physical particle itself, like an electron or a [[proton]], but a way to mathematically simplify complex behaviors.\n\nIn many materials, particles like [[electrons]] interact with each other and with the atoms in the material. These interactions can be incredibly complex. To make sense of them, scientists use the idea of a quasiparticle.\n\nA quasiparticle behaves as if it's a single particle, even though it's really representing the combined effects of many real particles. By using quasiparticles, scientists can apply the equations and principles that work for individual particles, making it easier to understand and predict how a material will behave. Essentially, quasiparticles are [[emergent]] phenomena that arise from the collective behavior of strongly interacting particles in a material.\n\nHere's a bit more detail about quasiparticles and why they are significant:\n\n1. **Not Real Particles**: Quasiparticles are not actual particles like [[electrons]] or photons. Instead, they are [[mathematical constructs]] that simplify the complex interactions between real particles in a solid. They allow physicists to describe those interactions as if they were simple, non-interacting particles moving through an effective medium.\n    \n2. **Effective Properties**: Quasiparticles have effective properties like mass, charge, and [[spin]], which might be different from the properties of the real particles in the system. For example, in a solid, an electron interacting with the lattice can be described as a quasiparticle called an \"electron quasiparticle\" with a different effective mass.\n    \n3. **Different Types**: There are many types of quasiparticles, each describing different collective excitations in a material. Examples include [[phonons]] ([[quantization|quantized]] lattice vibrations), [[magnons]] ([[spin waves]]), [[excitons]] (bound electron-hole pairs), and [[anyons]] (particles with fractional statistics), including the [[Majorana fermions]] that you mentioned earlier.\n    \n4. **Fractional Charge**: In some systems, such as the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]], quasiparticles can have fractional charges. This fractionalization is a profound quantum phenomenon that emerges from the collective behavior of [[electrons]].\n    \n5. **Role in Superconductivity**: Quasiparticles are crucial in the theory of superconductivity. Cooper pairs, for instance, are quasiparticles formed by pairs of [[electrons]] with opposite momenta and [[spin]], which enable the phenomenon of superconductivity at low temperatures.\n    \n6. **Use in [[Quantum Computing]]**: Certain quasiparticles, such as [[anyons]], have been proposed as the basis for [[topological]] [[Quantum Computing]], as their [[Braiding]] statistics can be used to perform fault-tolerant quantum operations.\n    \n7. **Fundamental Understanding**: The concept of quasiparticles has deepened our understanding of condensed matter systems.

However, if there is another observer O' moving relative to O, it is possible that in O's frame of reference, event A occurs before event B or vice versa.\n\nThis happens because, in special relativity, space and time are intertwined into a single four-[[dimensional]] entity known as [[space-time|spacetime]], and the 'slicing' of spacetime into distinct moments of time can change based on an observer's state of motion. This leads to phenomena like time dilation and length contraction, and it makes simultaneity a relative, rather than absolute, concept.\n\nIn terms of its philosophical implications, the relativity of simultaneity complicates our intuitive notion of the present and can challenge theories like [[presentism]], which asserts that only the present moment is real. It has led some philosophers and physicists to favor theories like [[Eternalism Theory]], which posits that all points in time are equally real, much as all points in space are equally real regardless of where an observer happens to be located.\n\nIn the context of the [[delayed choice experiment]], if we were to treat the \"choice\" and the \"effect\" as two separate events, the relativity of simultaneity could potentially allow an [[observation|observer]] to see the \"effect\" before the \"choice\", which aligns with the seemingly retroactive influence observed in the experiment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that both quantum mechanics and relativity are [[deterministic]] theories, so these seeming violations of [[causality]] do not allow for \"changing the past\" in the sense of free will or conscious [[control]] over past events.

These geometric patterns are found throughout the natural world and in man-made structures, particularly in religious art and architecture. Some key concepts in sacred geometry include the golden ratio, Fibonacci sequence, platonic solids, and various other geometric symbols and constructions.\n\n1.

Fibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.).

The square magnitude of this amplitude gives the probability for the process to occur.\n\n2. **[[Feynman diagram|Feynman Diagrams]]**: Traditionally, scattering amplitudes were calculated using Feynman diagrams. Each diagram represents a certain term in a perturbative expansion of the amplitude, with lines representing particle propagators and vertices representing interactions. For processes involving many particles, the number of Feynman diagrams can grow rapidly, making calculations cumbersome.\n\n3. **Modern Techniques**: Over the past few decades, researchers have developed more efficient methods to compute scattering amplitudes, bypassing the need for individual Feynman diagrams. Techniques like the \"spinor helicity formalism\" and \"[[twistor theory]]\" have provided more compact expressions for certain scattering processes. The \"amplituhedron\" is a geometric approach to understanding scattering amplitudes without relying on [[space-time|spacetime]] locality or unitarity in the conventional sense.\n\n4. **Physical Applications**: Scattering amplitudes are crucial for making predictions in particle colliders. For example, to search for new particles at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), physicists need precise predictions for what signals standard particles will produce. These predictions are derived from scattering amplitudes. Any deviation from the prediction might hint at new physics.\n\n5. **Beyond the Perturbative Regime**: While many techniques are rooted in perturbation theory, some processes (like those involving strong coupling) require non-perturbative approaches. Here, scattering amplitudes can be more challenging to compute, and this is an active area of research.\n\n6. **Mathematical Richness**: The study of scattering amplitudes has unveiled deep mathematical structures within quantum field theory, linking seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics and physics. The aforementioned [[amplituhedron]] is just one example of these newfound connections.\n\nUnderstanding scattering amplitudes is crucial both for fundamental research in theoretical physics and for practical experiments in particle physics.

This happens because you can loop around the compact space, each time following a longer and longer path. This is analogous to walking on Earth: you can travel the shortest path along the great circle between two cities, or you could decide to go the other way around the globe, which gives you a longer path.\n\nThe same concept applies to the Seifert-Weber dodecahedral space but in a hyperbolic context.

The concept itself is deeply rooted in theoretical physics and is an attempt to solve the [[black hole information paradox]].\n\nHere's a brief explanation: Black holes, as originally described by [[general relativity]], are very simple objects, defined only by their mass, charge, and angular momentum, a property known as the \"no-hair theorem.\" This means black holes \"have no hair\" \u2014 they have no other distinguishing features. This \"soft hair\" consists of quantum-level fluctuations and perturbations that carry some form of information. The existence of this \"soft hair\" could provide a mechanism for the preservation of information in a black hole, potentially helping to resolve the black hole information paradox.\n\nThe black hole information paradox arises from the idea that if an object falls into a [[black hole]], the information about its state seems to be lost to the [[universe]], which conflicts with the principles of quantum mechanics that information can't be destroyed.\n\nStephen Hawking, Malcolm Perry and Andrew Strominger proposed that black holes might have a kind of \"soft hair,\" subtle imprints left by incoming particles on the [[event horizon]] (the boundary of the black hole). These \"hairs\" would carry information about what had fallen into the black hole, preserving it at least in some form, and potentially resolving the information paradox.\n\nThe soft hair theorem adds a level of complexity to the previously held notion of black holes and, while not entirely solving the paradox, contributes to the ongoing discussion on the fundamental nature of black holes in the universe. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, research in this area continues.\n\n\n\nYet scientists have begun to wonder if the \u201cno-hair theorem\u201d is strictly true. In 2012, a mathematician named\u00a0Stefanos Aretakis\u00a0\u2014 then at the University of Cambridge and now at the University of Toronto \u2014 suggested that some black holes\u00a0might have instabilities\u00a0on their event horizons. These instabilities would effectively give some regions of a black hole\u2019s horizon a stronger gravitational pull than others. That would make otherwise identical black holes\u00a0distinguishable.\n\nHowever, his equations only showed that this was possible for so-called extremal black holes \u2014 ones that have a maximum value possible for either their mass, spin or charge. And as far as we know, \u201cthese black holes cannot exist, at least exactly, in nature,\u201d said Chesler.\n\nBut what if you had a near-extremal black hole, one that approached these extreme values but didn\u2019t quite reach them? Such a black hole should be able to exist, at least in theory. Could it have detectable violations of the no-hair theorem?\n\nIn particular, the scientists suggest that remnants either of the black hole\u2019s formation or of later disturbances, such as matter falling into the black hole, could create gravitational instabilities on or near the event horizon of a near-extremal black hole. \u201cWe would expect that the gravitational signal we would see would be quite different from ordinary black holes that are not extremal,\u201d said Khanna.\n\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/in-violation-of-einstein-black-holes-might-have-hair-20210211/\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/space-time.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/space-time.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d367a823c7a3ca2655ba05564d47d60ccd0a85107294842fb9b269d56a674a6d", "text": "---\naliases: spacetime\n---\nIn physics, space-time is a fundamental concept that combines the three dimensions of space (length, width, and height) with the dimension of [[Time]] into a four-[[dimensional]] framework.

This means that the geometry of space-time is influenced by the distribution of matter and energy within it. Mass and energy curve the fabric of space-time, causing it to become warped or curved.\n\nThe curvature of space-time is described by Einstein's field equations, which relate the distribution of matter and energy to the curvature of space-time.

In regions of high mass or energy density, space-time is more strongly curved, leading to the effects of gravity.\n\nSpace-time can be visualized as a four-dimensional \"fabric\" that can be stretched, curved, and warped by the presence of matter and energy.

It is based on two postulates:\n\n1. The Principle of Relativity: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in any inertial frame of reference; no [[observation|observer]] has a preferred or special perspective.\n\n2. The Constancy of the Speed of Light: Light in a vacuum travels at a constant speed c (approximately 299,792 kilometers per second), regardless of the state of motion of the light source or the observer.\n\nFrom these two postulates, a wide range of physical consequences are derived:\n\n- [[Time]] Dilation: Moving clocks run slower than stationary ones, as observed by a stationary observer. The time \u0394t' in a moving frame would be dilated according to the relation \u0394t' = \u03b3\u0394t, where \u0394t is the time in the stationary frame and \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor defined as \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1-v^2/c^2) with v being the relative velocity of the two frames.\n\n- Length Contraction: Moving objects are shortened in the direction of motion, as observed by a stationary observer. The length L' in a moving frame would be contracted according to the relation L' = L/\u03b3, where L is the length in the stationary frame.\n\n- Relativity of Simultaneity: Two events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are not generally simultaneous in another frame moving relative to the first.\n\n- Mass-[[energy]] Equivalence: Energy and mass are related by the famous equation E=mc^2, where E is the energy of a system, m is its mass, and c is the speed of light. This implies that energy can be converted into mass and vice versa.\n\n- Momentum and Energy: In special relativity, momentum and energy still obey conservation laws, but they combine into a four-vector in spacetime, leading to modifications of the classical expressions. The energy E of a particle of mass m moving with velocity v is given by E = \u03b3mc^2, and the relativistic momentum is p = \u03b3mv.\n\nSpecial relativity has been extremely successful in predicting experimental results and is a cornerstone of modern physics.

It is a quantum mechanical property that is not directly related to classical spinning motion. Instead, it is a fundamental quantum property that describes the intrinsic angular momentum of the particle.\n\nOne way to think about spin is to consider the analogy of a spinning top. A spinning top has both angular momentum and spin, but unlike a spinning top, particles with spin do not physically rotate around an axis. Instead, their spin is an intrinsic property that determines how they interact with other particles and fields.\n\nSpin can take on [[discrete]] ([[quantization]]) values, which are typically multiples of half integers, such as 1/2, 1, 3/2, etc. The magnitude of the spin is related to the amount of intrinsic angular [[momentum]] the particle possesses. The direction of the spin is related to the orientation of the particle's angular [[momentum]] relative to an external [[magnetic field]].\n\nThe spin of a particle can exist in a [[superposition]] of states, which means that it can be in multiple states simultaneously. For example, an electron can be in a [[superposition]] of spin-up and spin-down states at the same time. When the spin of a particle is measured, the [[superposition]] collapses into one of the possible states with a certain [[probability]].\n\nThe collapse of the [[superposition]] into a singular state is known as the [[wave function collapse]] or measurement collapse. It occurs when the [[wavefunction]], which describes the [[probability]] distribution of the possible states of a system, collapses to a definite state due to an [[observation]] or measurement. In other words, the act of measurement causes the system to \"choose\" a specific state from the set of possibilities described by the [[superposition]].\n\nWhen you observe the spin of a particle, you are measuring its spin along a particular axis. The spin of a particle can have different values along different axes, and these different spin values are related to the particle's angular momentum. When you measure the spin of a particle along a particular axis, the result of the measurement will be one of the allowed spin values for that axis.\n\nIf you have a pair of entangled particles, and you measure the spin of one of the particles along a particular axis, the other particle will have a spin along the opposite direction. This is known as [[Quantum Entanglement]], and it is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. However, it is important to note that the choice of axis along which you measure the spin of the entangled particle is [[random]], and the outcome of the measurement is also [[random]] and unpredictable. This means that you cannot use [[Quantum Entanglement]] to communicate faster than the speed of [[light]] or to violate [[causality]].\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the choice of axis or direction for measuring the spin of a particle is not completely arbitrary. However, it is also not determined by any physical property of the particle being measured.\n\nThe act of choosing the axis or direction for [[observation]] is typically done by the experimenter and is not determined by the laws of physics. However, the measurement outcome will depend on the quantum state of the particle, and the measurement process itself will generally change that state in some way.\n\nIt is worth noting that in some cases, the choice of axis or direction for measurement may be constrained by certain symmetries or other physical properties of the system being measured. For example, if a particle is known to be symmetric around a particular axis, it may make sense to measure its spin along that axis. However, this does not change the fact that the choice of axis is ultimately made by the experimenter and is not a fundamental property of the particle being measured.\n\nthe state of a particle is described by a [[wavefunction]] that encodes all of its possible properties, including its spin. However, the act of measurement can only reveal one particular property of the particle at a time, and in the case of spin, the choice of which property to measure is somewhat arbitrary.\n\nWhen measuring spin, one typically chooses an axis or direction in space along which to measure the particle's spin. However, there are an [[infinite]] number of possible directions in space, so the choice of which direction to measure is somewhat arbitrary. The [[probability]] of finding the particle in any particular direction is determined by the [[wavefunction]] of the particle.\n\nWhen two particles are entangled, their wavefunctions are related in a way that depends on the initial state of the system. This means that measuring the spin of one particle instantly affects the spin of the other particle, regardless of how far apart they are. However, the choice of which axis to measure is still arbitrary, and the results of the measurement are [[random]].\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/standard model.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/standard model.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "9a18ff906d24e1ae680627da2b188b6b965d5e8b6d15d26b2de3f1cde23d4b13", "text": "The Standard Model is a theory in physics that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions, excluding [[gravity]].

It's a type of [[Quantum Field Theory]] - which describes the fundamental forces and particles in the [[universe]] - but it also includes [[gravity]], something that other quantum field theories typically don't account for.\n\nThe key idea behind supersymmetry is that there's a deep [[symmetry]] in nature between particles of two types: [[bosons]], which include particles like photons and [[gluon|gluons]] and obey one type of quantum statistics, and [[fermions]], which include particles like [[electrons]] and [[quark|quarks]] and obey a different type of quantum statistics.\n\nSupersymmetry posits that for every known boson, there's a corresponding fermion, and vice versa, although these \"superpartners\" have yet to be discovered. This idea leads to a lot of potential benefits, including a solution to the hierarchy problem in physics, which is about why gravity is so much weaker than the other fundamental forces.\n\nSupergravity takes this concept and marries it with general relativity, Einstein's theory of gravity. The first supergravity theories were formulated in the 1970s, and they were 4-[[dimensional]], like our familiar [[space-time|spacetime]]. However, it was later discovered that the most elegant and consistent formulations of supergravity exist in higher dimensions, with the most famous one being 11-dimensional supergravity.\n\nInterestingly, 11-dimensional supergravity is believed to be a low-energy limit of [[M-theory]], which is a candidate for a theory of everything and a potential unifier of all five versions of [[String theory]]. In this way, supergravity is a key part of some of the most ambitious attempts to fully understand the laws of the universe.\n\nEleven-dimensional supergravity was the maximum number of dimensions in which supergravity could be formulated. It was initially discovered by Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk in 1978. This version of supergravity included not only the familiar graviton, the particle associated with gravity, but also other exotic entities like a 3-index gauge field and a [[gravitino]].\n\nWitten proposed that M-theory, which was still only partially understood, was a strongly coupled limit of the previously known Type IIA string theory and that it was described at low energies by 11-dimensional supergravity. This meant that 11-dimensional supergravity was a crucial part of understanding the ultimate theory of everything.\n\nIt's important to note that while the mathematics of 11-dimensional supergravity (and of M-theory) is well-established, the physical interpretation - how it relates to our four-dimensional world, how to describe the extra dimensions, etc. - is still an active area of research.\n\nHow can we picture these extra dimensions? One helpful analogy is to consider a garden hose viewed from far away. It appears as a line (one-dimensional). But as we get closer, we see that it also has a circular dimension, making it two-dimensional. The extra dimensions in M-theory could be similar \u2013 visible only at extremely small, quantum scales.\n\nAlternatively, these extra dimensions could be 'large' but we're confined to a four-dimensional 'brane' (short for membrane) inside the higher-dimensional space. This idea is used in certain variants of string theory and M-theory, particularly in models of brane cosmology.\n\nBut what could these extra dimensions do? Well, they could be critical to unifying the fundamental forces of nature. The differences between the forces and their relative strengths might simply be due to how they interact with these extra dimensions. Also, they could give rise to the fundamental particles we observe, since in string theory, particles are essentially tiny strings vibrating in these multiple dimensions, and the mode of vibration determines the particle's properties.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/superposition.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/superposition.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5bb546161ca0201c7d670c4d9d32f79edd00e59016304f78604c50510b704859", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/supersymmetry.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/supersymmetry.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "988f96c2ea1fc24f6a52e19fcefd77236ecccc34ecb446a01abb535e217ad648", "text": "Supersymmetry is a proposed principle of physics that suggests every fundamental fermion (matter particle) has a corresponding boson (force particle), and vice versa. These corresponding particles are known as \"superpartners\". As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, these superpartner particles have not yet been observed.\n\n[[fermions]] are particles that make up matter, such as [[electrons]] and [[quark|quarks]]. They have half-integer [[spin]] (e.g., 1/2, 3/2) and obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which means that no two [[fermions]] can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\n[[bosons]], on the other hand, mediate forces and can have integer spins (e.g., 0, 1, 2). They obey [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] and can occupy the same quantum state. Photons (light particles), [[gluon|gluons]] (strong force carriers), and the hypothesized gravitons ([[gravity]] force carriers) are examples of [[bosons]].\n\nAccording to supersymmetry, each fermion should have a superpartner boson, and each boson should have a superpartner fermion. For example, the superpartner of the electron (a fermion) is called the \"selectron\" (a boson), and the superpartner of the [[photon]] (a boson) is called the \"photino\" (a fermion).\n\nOne reason supersymmetry is intriguing is because it could solve some theoretical problems in physics. For instance, it might resolve the \"hierarchy problem\", which is the question of why the weak force is so much stronger than gravity. In the [[standard model]] of particle physics, quantum effects should make these forces roughly equal unless something (like supersymmetry) intervenes.\n\nMoreover, if supersymmetry is a true [[symmetry]] of nature, some superpartners could serve as viable candidates for [[Dark Matter]], the mysterious substance that makes up about 27% of the universe.\n\nHowever, despite extensive searches at particle colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), no supersymmetric particles have been discovered as of 2021. This doesn't necessarily mean supersymmetry is wrong, but it suggests that if it exists, it might be \"broken\" at the energy scales we have been able to probe. That is, the superpartners might be heavier than their Standard Model counterparts, making them harder to produce and detect. Further experiments and theoretical work are needed to understand the full implications and status of supersymmetry.\n\nAnother challenge is the \"fine-tuning problem\". Supersymmetry was initially attractive because it offered a natural solution to the hierarchy problem \u2013 the question of why the Higgs boson is much lighter than the Planck scale. However, the discovery of the Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV at the LHC has reintroduced a fine-tuning problem into many supersymmetric models. To reconcile the observed Higgs mass with these models often requires a certain amount of \"fine-tuning\" of the parameters in the theory, making them appear less \"natural\".\n\nFurthermore, certain observations in cosmology constrain supersymmetric models. For instance, measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation provide information about the amount of light elements produced in the early universe (a period known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis). These abundances depend on the number of light particle species (neutrinos) in the early universe. If supersymmetric particles were light and stable, they could contribute to this number and potentially conflict with observations.\n\nThe constraints from dark matter detection experiments also pose challenges. Some supersymmetric models predict that the lightest supersymmetric particle (often a neutralino) could be a dark matter candidate. However, direct dark matter detection experiments and indirect searches (e.g., looking for annihilation signals) have not found evidence for these particles, imposing further constraints on supersymmetric models.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the challenges that supersymmetry faces. Despite these, it's important to note that none of these issues definitively rule out supersymmetry. They merely constrain what types of supersymmetric models could potentially be correct. The search for supersymmetry continues both in theoretical work and in experiments at the high-energy frontier.\n\nThese problems include the [[hierarchy problem]] (why is gravity so weak compared to other forces?) and the lack of a dark matter candidate within the standard model particles.\n\nThis would leave physicists to look for other solutions or new theories to address these issues. Here are some alternative ideas:\n\n1. Composite Higgs Models: The [[Higgs boson]] might not be a fundamental particle, but a composite of other particles. This would make the Higgs similar to how protons and neutrons are made up of [[quark|quarks]]. This could potentially address the hierarchy problem.\n    \n2. Extra Dimensions: Theories with extra dimensions, like string theory, could provide solutions to the problems in the standard model. The hierarchy problem might be resolved by gravity leaking into these extra dimensions, making it appear weaker in our 3-dimensional world.\n    \n3. Dark Sector Theories: These theories propose a whole new sector of dark particles that interact weakly with the standard model particles. These could provide candidates for [[Dark Matter]].\n    \n4. Quantum Gravity: We might need a quantum theory of gravity to fully understand the universe at the highest energies. This could involve a fundamentally different framework from standard quantum field theories.\n    \n5. Adjustments to the Standard Model: Instead of introducing new [[symmetry|symmetries]] or particles, some physicists propose that we need a deeper understanding of the current [[standard model]], including the possibility that some of its approximations or assumptions might need to be revised.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/symmetry breaking.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/symmetry breaking.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "4033826466863baf4a32891c5d8e5b1d085c3803f7c9bfb302c4fe7284b8de47", "text": "In the context of the Big Bang theory, symmetry breaking refers to a fundamental change in the symmetry properties of the [[universe]] during its early stages.

Symmetry can be found at various levels, such as spatial symmetry (e.g., rotational or translational symmetry) and symmetry in the laws of physics (e.g., conservation of energy or momentum).\n\nQuantum entanglement, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that their quantum states are intertwined.

This [[non-locality|non-local]] correlation is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally confirmed.\n\nThe connection between symmetry and [[Quantum Entanglement]] lies in the understanding that certain symmetries can give rise to entanglement. For example, in quantum field theories, symmetries such as gauge symmetries can lead to the creation of entangled particle-[[antiparticles|antiparticle]] pairs. Additionally, the study of quantum entanglement has shed light on the concept of [[entanglement entropy]], which relates to the information content and symmetry properties of entangled systems.\n\nOverall, symmetry and quantum entanglement are interconnected concepts that provide insights into the fundamental nature of the universe at both the macroscopic and quantum levels.

This path is only open if one can reliably produce a topological phase of matter and experimentally verify that the sub-components of a qubit are in a topological phase (and ready for quantum information processing). Doing so is not trivial because topological phases are characterized by the long-ranged entanglement of their ground states, which is not readily accessible to conventional experimental probes.\n\n In this context, it refers to the idea that the information stored in these qubits is not held in a specific location, but is instead stored in the overall properties of the system.\n\nOne of the main advantages of topological qubits is their potential for greater stability and error resistance. Because the information they store is distributed across a system, it is less susceptible to being disrupted by changes to any individual particle. \n\n\nMicrosoft's Quantum Computing project, for example, has been heavily invested in researching and developing topological qubits.

TS provides the raw data, the infinite possibilities of existence, while the Holographic Principle offers the means to encode this data on a two-dimensional surface. Our reality, then, emerges as a projection from this surface, a decoding of the information stored within. This dance highlights the emergent nature of time and space, suggesting that they are not fundamental entities, but rather phenomena arising from the intricate interplay of information.\n\nTo further understand the intricate relationship between Total Simultaneity and the Holographic Principle, we must delve into the quantum realm. Quantum mechanics, with its inherent uncertainty and non-locality, provides a natural bridge between these two concepts. Particles can exist in multiple states at once, only settling into a definite state upon observation\u2014a phenomenon that echoes the coexistence of all moments in TS. Furthermore, the concept of quantum entanglement, where particles remain connected regardless of distance, resonates with the holographic idea that all information is interconnected and accessible from any point in space.\n\nBlack holes play a crucial role in the development of the Holographic Principle, as they challenge our understanding of information and its preservation. The black hole information paradox, which questions whether information that falls into a black hole is lost forever, finds a potential resolution in the Holographic Principle. Information is not lost but rather encoded on the event horizon, preserving it in a two-dimensional form. This concept is further supported by string theory, which posits that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are one-dimensional strings rather than point particles. These strings vibrate at different frequencies, creating the particles and forces we observe. In this framework, the universe itself can be viewed as a giant hologram, where the information encoded in strings is projected to create our perceived reality.\n\nIn this interconnected tapestry of reality, consciousness emerges as the navigator, translating the information encoded in the holographic universe and navigating the possibilities housed within Total Simultaneity. Consciousness is not a passive observer; it actively shapes and constructs the reality we experience. It is the key that unlocks the potentialities of TS, selecting the moments and experiences that form our subjective reality. In this sense, consciousness is both the creator and the experiencer of reality, bridging the gap between the potential and the manifest.\n\nIn this framework, the boundaries between reality and illusion become blurred. What we perceive as solid and tangible is revealed to be a projection, a manifestation of information encoded on a distant surface. The reality we experience is one of many possibilities housed within Total Simultaneity, selected and brought into existence by our consciousness.

Cramer in 1986, offers a unique way to understand quantum phenomena. It employs a \"handshake\" between the future and the past to explain the puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement. This interpretation is grounded in the formalism of quantum mechanics, specifically the solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which can be both \"retarded\" (moving forward in time) and \"advanced\" (moving backward in time).\n\nIn the Transactional Interpretation, when a quantum system is prepared in a particular state (say, an electron emitted from an atom), it sends out a \"retarded\" wavefunction moving forward in time towards all possible future states. When a measurement or interaction occurs (for example, the electron being absorbed by another atom), another wavefunction is generated, this time an \"advanced\" wavefunction moving backward in time towards the original quantum system. The interaction between the retarded and advanced wavefunctions forms a \"handshake\" across time, establishing a \"transaction\" that determines the outcome of the measurement or interaction.\n\nThis handshake ensures that the conservation laws (like conservation of energy, momentum, etc.) are satisfied, as the advanced wavefunction effectively \"confirms\" that the future interaction will happen in such a way that these laws are upheld. The transaction is only completed when both the retarded and advanced wavefunctions meet and are able to satisfy these conservation laws. Until that happens, the quantum system remains in a superposition of all possible states, consistent with the standard quantum formalism.\n\nOne of the appealing aspects of the Transactional Interpretation is that it provides a straightforward way to understand quantum entanglement. In the case of entangled particles, the retarded wavefunction from one particle and the advanced wavefunction from the other particle form a handshake, instantaneously determining the states of both particles when one of them is measured, regardless of the distance separating them. This is in line with the experimental results that confirm the non-local correlations between entangled particles but avoids the need for \"spooky action at a distance,\" as Einstein called it.\n\nHowever, the Transactional Interpretation is not without its criticisms and challenges:\n\n1. **Causality**: The use of advanced wavefunctions, which move backward in time, raises questions about causality. However, proponents argue that these advanced wavefunctions are not physical entities but mathematical tools, so they do not violate causality.\n\n2. **Multiple Transactions**: In scenarios where multiple transactions are possible, it's not entirely clear how the interpretation selects the one that actually occurs. Some extensions to the original interpretation, like the \"Possibilist Transactional Interpretation,\" have been proposed to address this issue.\n\n3. **Empirical Equivalence**: Like many other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the Transactional Interpretation is empirically equivalent to the standard quantum formalism, meaning it doesn't make any new testable predictions. This makes it challenging to confirm or falsify through experiment.\n\n4. **Philosophical Implications**: The Transactional Interpretation has been both praised and criticized for its philosophical implications, particularly regarding its treatment of time, causality, and reality itself.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Transactional Interpretation remains an interesting and active area of research, offering a novel way to understand the counterintuitive phenomena of quantum mechanics.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/transcendental.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/transcendental.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "db9c560f96b03fcf3be2e2cae2fec5395a36f478f693ffc6b59af3f2742c4c09", "text": "\"Ego dissolving\" or \"transcendental\" experiences are often discussed in the context of [[meditation]], psychedelics, and certain religious or spiritual practices.

However, such searches help to place limits on the properties of potential ultralight dark matter particles, thereby helping to refine the models and guide future searches.\nThey do, however, find mild evidence for an ULDM signal with frequency around 4 nHz, but this signal is difficult to interpret because the corresponding ULDM masses required to explain this signal are in conflict with other astrophysical observations, such as those from [[Lyman-alpha forest observations]], [[galactic subhalo mass functions]], and [[stellar kinematics]].\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/ultraviolet catastrophe.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/ultraviolet catastrophe.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "bc94385c85d610f5e901128f04742aa5b9e68f080a3b29e38d4085cb595cb08e", "text": "It's a paradox that was proposed within the classical understanding of black-body radiation.\n\nAccording to classical physics, the [[energy]] radiated by a black body (an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation) at high [[frequency]] (i.e., short [[wavelength]], towards the ultraviolet end of the spectrum) should theoretically become infinite. This is what they meant by \"greater than the energy of the [[universe]]\"\u2014the calculations suggested that there should be an infinite amount of ultraviolet light radiated by a black body, which is physically absurd.\n\nMax [[Planck]] solved this problem by proposing that energy is [[quantization|quantized]], meaning that it can only exist in [[discrete]], indivisible units. In the context of black body radiation, this meant that the energy of the oscillators in the body is proportional to the frequency of their oscillation, with a constant of proportionality that came to be known as [[Planck's constant]].\n\nThis marked a departure from classical physics, where energy was thought to be continuous and could take on any value. The quantum hypothesis laid the groundwork for the development of quantum mechanics, which describes the surprising and counterintuitive behavior of particles on the microscopic scale.\n\nPlanck's hypothesis, while initially met with skepticism, was later supported by Albert Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, which also relied on the idea of energy [[quanta]].

However, in quantum mechanics, there is a fundamental limit to how precisely we can measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. This limit is described by the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe uncertainty principle states that the more precisely we know the position of a particle, the less precisely we can know its momentum, and vice versa. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n\u0394x * \u0394p >= h/4\u03c0\n\nwhere \u0394x is the uncertainty in the position of the particle, \u0394p is the uncertainty in its momentum, and h is [[Planck]]'s constant.\n\nThis means that if we make a precise measurement of the position of a particle, the momentum becomes more uncertain. Similarly, if we make a precise measurement of the momentum, the position becomes more uncertain. This is not due to a limitation in our measurement devices, but rather is a fundamental property of the quantum world. \n\nThe uncertainty principle has important implications for the behavior of particles at the quantum level. It is the [[Energy Time Uncertainty Principle]] that explains why electrons in atoms occupy [[discrete]] energy levels instead of any energy level in between. It also plays a crucial role in the phenomenon of quantum tunneling, where a particle can pass through a potential barrier even though its energy is less than the barrier height.\n\n[[Complementarity]] is another important concept in quantum mechanics that is related to the uncertainty principle. [[Complementarity]] refers to the idea that certain physical properties of a system are complementary, meaning they cannot be observed simultaneously with arbitrary precision. For example, the position and momentum of a particle are complementary properties.\n\nThe uncertainty principle and [[Complementarity]] are two sides of the same coin. The uncertainty principle places a fundamental limit on the precision with which we can measure certain physical properties, and complementarity describes the complementary nature of certain physical properties. Together, they help us understand the strange behavior of particles at the quantum level and have important implications for our understanding of the nature of reality.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/universe.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/universe.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/unknown.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/unknown.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/vagal nerve.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/vagal nerve.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "92ebd83140d46e5007072c1e733b76b293427c3eaafc00bbabcb4a8cbab7dba4", "text": "The vagus nerve, also known as the tenth cranial nerve, is one of the most important nerves in the body.

It's a measure of the uncertainty or disorder associated with a quantum system, giving a quantitative understanding of the \"mixedness\" of a state.\n\nIn a classical system, Shannon entropy measures the uncertainty associated with a random variable. In a quantum system, von Neumann entropy serves a similar role, quantifying the uncertainty associated with a mixed state.\n\nA mixed state in quantum mechanics is a statistical mixture of different quantum states, often represented by a density matrix. A pure state is a special case of a mixed state where there is no uncertainty about the state of the system. In contrast, a mixed state occurs when we have a statistical ensemble of different possible states, each occurring with a certain probability.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy of a quantum system is defined as:\n\n$$ S(\\rho) = -\\text{Tr}(\\rho \\log \\rho)$$\n\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the density matrix of the system, and $$\\text{Tr}$$ denotes the trace operation.\n\nSome key properties and insights into von Neumann entropy include:\n\n1. **Quantifying Entanglement**: Von Neumann entropy can be used to quantify the [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]] between parts of a composite system. For example, the [[entropy]] of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem can give information about how entangled that subsystem is with the rest of the system.\n\n2. **Zero for Pure States**: If the system is in a pure state, the von Neumann entropy is zero.

This represents maximum uncertainty about the system.\n\n4. **Non-Increasing Under Quantum Operations**: The von Neumann entropy doesn't increase when you apply local quantum operations.

In simple terms, it combines the possibilities of a particle's location, momentum, spin, and other properties all at once.\n\nHowever, the wavefunction itself can't be measured directly, and its physical interpretation is the subject of ongoing debate in quantum mechanics. \n\nThe squared magnitude of the wavefunction, |\u03a8|^2, gives the [[probability]] distribution of the outcomes of measurements on the system. This is known as the [[Born rule]], named after physicist Max Born. It tells us that if we were to measure the position (or [[momentum]], or any other property) of a particle, the probability of finding the particle in a particular state is given by the square of the wavefunction.\n\nFor example, if you have a particle in a box (a common scenario in introductory quantum mechanics), the wavefunction describes the state of the particle in the box. The square of this wavefunction gives the probability distribution of the particle's position: it tells you how likely you are to find the particle at each point in the box if you were to measure its position.\n\nIt's important to note that the probability distribution is not generally uniform. In other words, the particle is not equally likely to be in any given place in the box. Instead, the probability distribution often has peaks and troughs, corresponding to regions where the particle is more likely or less likely to be found.\n\nA wavefunction can also be used to calculate the expectation values of an observable in a state. The expectation value is the average of all the possible outcomes of a measurement, weighted by their probabilities. \n\nUnderstanding and manipulating wavefunctions is a fundamental part of quantum mechanics. Wavefunctions are used to predict the outcomes of experiments and to describe the behavior of particles in a wide range of scenarios, from simple systems like the hydrogen atom to complex phenomena like superconductivity and quantum computing.\n\nLastly, it's important to mention the principle of superposition, which is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. That is, the wavefunction can be a combination of multiple different states, and the system doesn't settle into a single state until a measurement is made, which is a fundamental feature of the quantum world.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/wavelength.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/wavelength.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/weak nuclear force.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/weak nuclear force.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "92edb3cb1b0e555b858fcf3e03389c0d0dcfadbd2eff1cde36e25609fd465eb5", "text": "The weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, is unique in that it does not conserve parity. In other words, the weak force does not behave the same way under a mirror reflection, a transformation known as parity inversion. \n\nThe key to understanding this lies in the fact that weak interactions only involve left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. In the language of quantum mechanics, we would say that the weak force only couples to particles with negative \"helicity\" (for particles, this is when the spin is opposite to the direction of motion) and antiparticles with positive \"helicity\" (when the [[spin]] is in the same direction as the motion).\n\nThis distinction becomes evident when you consider a process like beta decay under a mirror reflection. If a neutron decays into a proton while emitting an electron (beta particle) and an electron antineutrino, you would see the emitted electron moving to the left in the mirror image. But because the weak force only interacts with left-handed particles and right-handed [[antiparticles]], this mirror-image decay (involving a right-handed electron) wouldn't occur in nature, which indicates the violation of parity.\n\nThe discovery of parity violation in weak interactions was made by Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang, for which they received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. Their theoretical work was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu in the same year in what is now known as the Wu experiment. This experiment, involving the beta decay of cobalt-60, conclusively showed that the weak force does not conserve parity.\n\n\n1. **Flavor Changing**: The weak force is responsible for changing one type or \"flavor\" of [[quark]] into another, a process that is fundamental to many forms of radioactive decay, such as beta decay.\n    \n2. **Intermediate Vector Bosons**: The force carriers for the weak force are the W and Z bosons, which are much heavier than the photons that carry the electromagnetic force or the gluons that carry the strong force. This gives the weak force a very short range, less than the size of an atomic nucleus.\n    \n3. **Electroweak Unification**: In the 1960s and 70s, physicists developed the electroweak theory, which unifies the weak force with [[electromagnetism]] at high energies. This unification predicted the existence of the W and Z [[bosons]] before they were experimentally detected, and also led to the prediction of the [[Higgs boson]]. The architects of this theory, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979.\n    \n4. **Role in the Sun**: The weak force plays a crucial role in the fusion reactions that power the Sun and other stars. Protons in the Sun's core use the weak force to change into neutrons, producing a positron and a [[neutrino]] in the process. This reaction is a key step in the proton-proton chain reaction, the dominant energy-producing process in the Sun.\n    \n5. **Neutrino Interactions**: The weak force is the only fundamental force that neutrinos interact with (apart from [[gravity]], which is much weaker and harder to detect). This makes neutrinos incredibly difficult to detect, as they can pass through vast amounts of matter without interacting.\n    \n6. [[strong CP problem|cp-violation]]: In addition to violating parity, the weak force also violates the combined symmetry of charge [[conjugate|conjugation]] and parity (known as [[Charge Parity]] symmetry). This was first observed in decays of the [[K-meson]] and has implications for why the [[universe]] contains more matter than antimatter. The discovery of CP violation earned James Cronin and Val Fitch the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/wim hof breathing.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/wim hof breathing.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "3fedb43156800b53de432e117edb879e7dbcf3b84c1bc1fbc517a021dc8518ed", "text": "  \nWim Hof breathing involves a specific breathing technique that involves hyperventilation and breath holding.

This increase in alpha brain waves may be associated with a relaxation response and reduced stress levels.\n\nAdditionally, another study found that regular practice of the Wim Hof breathing method resulted in increased activity in the [[prefrontal cortex]], a region of the brain involved in cognitive control and emotion regulation. \n\nOne study found that during the practice of the Wim Hof method, participants had increased alpha and [[theta waves|theta]] oscillations in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attention and cognitive control.

An event in spacetime is defined by three spatial coordinates (such as length, width, height) and one time coordinate.\n\n2. **Trajectory Through Spacetime**: The world line of an object (like a particle or a person) is the path that this object takes through spacetime. If you graphed this path, the x, y, and z axes might represent the three spatial dimensions, and the t-axis would represent time.\n\n3. **Time as a Dimension**: In this context, time is treated just like another dimension of space. As you move along a world line from the past to the future, you are moving along the time axis in much the same way you would move along the x-axis to travel east.\n\n4. **Light Cones**: World lines are closely related to the concept of light cones, which represent the path that light could travel from a given event. Anything inside the light cone can affect or be affected by the event, while anything outside the light cone cannot. The world line of a particle traveling at the speed of light would lie along the edge of this cone.\n\n5. **World Lines in Different Observers**: Different observers moving relative to one another will disagree about the spatial coordinates of an event but will agree on a mathematical combination of the spatial and temporal coordinates known as the spacetime interval.

This is a direct physical proof of the quantum theory of energy levels in atoms. \n\nWhen an atom is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic field can interact with the magnetic moment of the atom. This interaction can cause a splitting of the energy levels, and hence, the [[spectral lines]] corresponding to transitions between these levels also split. This splitting is known as the Zeeman effect.\n\nThere are two types of Zeeman effect: the normal Zeeman effect, which occurs in atoms that have no net orbital angular momentum, and the anomalous Zeeman effect, which occurs in atoms that do have net orbital angular momentum. The anomalous Zeeman effect is more complicated than the normal Zeeman effect and the energy splitting does not strictly follow the prediction of the simple Zeeman effect.\n\nThe Zeeman effect has been used in various applications such as measuring magnetic fields of astronomical bodies, atomic and molecular [[spectroscopy]], and understanding the structures of atoms and molecules.
