Some recent findings include:\n\n1. Environmental factors: Research suggests that environmental factors, such as exposure to toxins, may play a role in the development of ADHD.\n\n2. Genetic factors: Recent studies have identified specific genes that may be linked to ADHD. For example, a study published in 2020 found that mutations in the DCLK1 gene were associated with an increased risk of ADHD.\n\n3. Brain development: Studies have shown that children with ADHD may have delays in the development of certain areas of the brain, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is responsible for executive function.\n\n4. Gut microbiome: Some studies have found that disruptions in the gut microbiome may be associated with ADHD. For example, a study published in 2021 found that children with ADHD had lower levels of certain types of gut bacteria compared to children without ADHD.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that [[FAAH]] production may be insufficient in the brains of individuals with ADHD, leading to the accumulation of [[anandamide]] and a subsequent [[dopamine deficiency]]. [[anandamide]] is known to play a role in [[dopamine]] release and regulation, and its accumulation may disrupt normal dopamine signaling in the brain, which has been implicated in ADHD. However, more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between FAAH, anandamide, dopamine, and ADHD. [[unknown]]\n\n[[CBD]] on the other hand, can modulate [[GABA]] activity. [[GABA]] is a neurotransmitter responsible for reducing [[neuronal excitability]], and when inhibited, [[dopamine]] production increases. [[CBD]] also stimulates adenosine receptors, encouraging dopamine release. \n\n\nThe activity of fatty acid amide hydrolyse ([[FAAH]]), which is responsible for AEA degradation, was significantly decreased in lymphocytes from peripheral blood of subjects with ADHD. This finding suggests that AEA catabolism is dysregulated in ADHD, whereas the synthesis of AEA was unaltered.\u00a0Stimulation of dopamine (DA) D2 class receptors inhibits [[FAAH]] activity and increases the level of AEA in the brain. A complex interaction between DA and the AEA endocannabinoid system (ECS) is found experimentally, and ECS is implicated in other DA-related disorders such as Parkinsonism. Dysfunction of the dopamine system is proposed to explain the clinical manifestations of ADHD.The [[endocannabinoid system]] plays an important role in brain development and [[anandamide]] (arachidonylethanolamide [AEA]) impairs [[memory]] and attention by reducing the activity of the dopamine transporter system.\n\nhttps://www.pediatricneurologybriefs.com/articles/10.15844/pedneurbriefs-23-6-7/\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/AI.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/AI.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "15feec6c89e3008c9c88b2f3166d36fee4f21bdda6c1087f0f4a7d2707c0e107", "text": "---\naliases: artificial intelligence\n---\n\nif [[Consciousness]] is a higher [[dimensional]] field we have connected to via [[psychedelics]] \ncan ai do shrooms \ncan i do shrooms with ai and we mad bond \n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/AdS CFT correspondence in string theory.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/AdS CFT correspondence in string theory.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "65b7295ce2cfdc8066d896ec9b9c1abe30254ca117379405e6a12b3dacc9f650", "text": "---\naliases: AdS/CFT correspondence\n---\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence, or Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence, also known as the Maldacena duality, is a conjecture in theoretical physics that has been influential in the development of [[String theory]]. It was first proposed by Juan Maldacena, a theoretical physicist, in 1997.\n\nThis correspondence provides a relationship between two different kinds of physical theories: a [[gravity]] theory in a certain kind of [[negative curvature]] (\"Anti-de Sitter\" or AdS) space, and a [[Quantum Field Theory]] defined on the boundary of that space, a Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Essentially, it states that [[String theory]] in an AdS space is equivalent to a CFT defined on the boundary of that space.\n\nWhat's particularly striking about this is the difference in dimensions between the two sides of the correspondence: the AdS side is a gravity theory in a higher-[[dimensional]] space, while the CFT side is a quantum field theory in one fewer dimension. This realization has led to a deeper understanding of the [[holographic principle]], a concept suggesting that all the information in a volume of space can be represented as information on a boundary of that space.\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence has proved to be an extremely useful tool in theoretical physics. It allows for a concrete realization of the [[holographic principle]], and provides a framework where [[quantum gravity]] can be studied using the tools of [[Quantum Field Theory]]. However, it's worth noting that while the correspondence has been tested in numerous ways and has many successful checks, it still remains a conjecture, as it hasn't been proven rigorously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Advaita Vedanta.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Advaita Vedanta.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d4679d71961076bc742144709ef23d30c0b43a4bb7f88fd5e0cbe4bf1fde698a", "text": "Advaita Vedanta is a philosophical and spiritual tradition rooted in the ancient scriptures of India, particularly in the Vedas and Upanishads. \"Advaita\" means \"non-dual\" in Sanskrit, and Advaita Vedanta is often referred to as the philosophy of non-dualism. It was formulated and popularized by the philosopher and theologian Adi Shankaracharya in the early 8th century.\n\nKey Concepts of Advaita Vedanta:\n\n1. **Non-Dualism ([[Advaita]]):** At the heart of Advaita Vedanta is the concept of non-dualism, which asserts that there is an ultimate reality that is unchanging, indivisible, and beyond the realm of duality. This ultimate reality is often referred to as Brahman. atman = brahman schrodinbger 2nd euation\n\n2. **[[Brahman]]:** Brahman is considered the ultimate reality or cosmic consciousness. It is described as formless, infinite, and beyond all attributes. According to Advaita Vedanta, everything in the universe is an expression or manifestation of Brahman.\n\n3. **Atman:** Atman refers to the individual self or soul. Advaita Vedanta teaches that the true nature of the individual Atman is identical to Brahman. In other words, the individual soul and the cosmic reality are fundamentally one and the same.\n\n4. **Maya:** Maya is the concept of illusion or the power that creates the appearance of duality in the world. It is the force that makes us perceive multiplicity and separation, while the ultimate reality is non-dual.\n\n5. **Jiva and Jivanmukta:** Jiva refers to the individual soul, while Jivanmukta refers to one who has attained liberation while still alive. In Advaita Vedanta, the realization of the non-dual nature of reality leads to liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).\n\n6. **Self-Realization (Jnana):** Advaita Vedanta emphasizes self-realization through direct insight (jnana) into the nature of reality. This realization comes from understanding the unity of Atman and Brahman and transcending the illusion of duality.\n\n7. **Scriptural Authority:** While emphasizing direct realization, Advaita Vedanta also acknowledges the importance of scriptures as a means to guide seekers and provide teachings on the nature of reality.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta has had a profound influence on Hindu philosophy, spirituality, and mysticism. It has also attracted the attention of scholars and seekers worldwide due to its emphasis on the unity of all existence and its exploration of the nature of reality beyond conventional dualistic perceptions.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0d51079fd4409b1ca5ea266e9cca3f8742461748cf74e4d64de8d0bcddf6424d", "text": "The Alcubierre warp drive is a speculative idea based on a solution to Einstein's field equations in [[general relativity]]. It was proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. The warp drive concept is named after Alcubierre's proposal, which involves a spacecraft achieving apparent superluminal travel (faster-than-light travel) by creating a bubble of [[negative energy]] density around it. \n\nThe core idea is that, while [[special relativity]] forbids objects from moving faster than light within spacetime, it is known that spacetime itself can be manipulated in ways that allows an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant [[observation|observer]]. \n\nThe Alcubierre drive concept involves distorting spacetime in such a way that it expands behind the spacecraft and contracts in front of it. If you imagine the spacecraft at rest in a small flat region of spacetime (the \"warp bubble\"), then this distortion moves the warp bubble as desired, and inside it the spacecraft can move towards its destination at conventional sub-light speeds, but when seen from outside, the destination and origin points are brought close together by the warp of the spacetime, effectively achieving superluminal travel.\n\nHowever, there are several substantial hurdles to the concept. For one, the Alcubierre drive requires negative energy densities, which have not been proven to exist. Secondly, the amounts of energy required for such a propulsion are estimated to be on the order of the mass-energy of a whole planet, if not more. There are also potential issues related to [[causality]], [[Quantum Field Theory]] in curved spacetime, and high-energy particle radiation.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Alcubierre warp drive remains a topic of interest because it's one of the few solutions to the equations of [[general relativity]] that allow for faster-than-light travel without the need for exotic matter with negative mass. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, it remains a purely theoretical concept with no known practical implementation.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/alchemy.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/alchemy.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0368c1d9751db55b1b3db9bfd942b13b8bc7ab50e9e3dbd444038f66f33a026a", "text": "Within the intricate web of our human experience, the notion of \"7 red roses manifestations\" emerges as a captivating metaphor.
