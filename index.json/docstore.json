For example, a study published in 2020 found that mutations in the DCLK1 gene were associated with an increased risk of ADHD.\n\n3. Brain development: Studies have shown that children with ADHD may have delays in the development of certain areas of the brain, such as the [[prefrontal cortex]], which is responsible for executive function.\n\n4.

For example, a study published in 2021 found that children with ADHD had lower levels of certain types of gut bacteria compared to children without ADHD.\n\nThere is some evidence to suggest that [[FAAH]] production may be insufficient in the brains of individuals with ADHD, leading to the accumulation of [[anandamide]] and a subsequent [[dopamine deficiency]]. [[anandamide]] is known to play a role in [[dopamine]] release and regulation, and its accumulation may disrupt normal dopamine signaling in the brain, which has been implicated in ADHD.

It was formulated and popularized by the philosopher and theologian Adi Shankaracharya in the early 8th century.\n\nKey Concepts of Advaita Vedanta:\n\n1. **Non-Dualism ([[Advaita]]):** At the heart of Advaita Vedanta is the concept of non-dualism, which asserts that there is an ultimate reality that is unchanging, indivisible, and beyond the realm of duality. This ultimate reality is often referred to as Brahman. atman = brahman schrodinbger 2nd euation\n\n2. **[[Brahman]]:** Brahman is considered the ultimate reality or cosmic consciousness. It is described as formless, infinite, and beyond all attributes. According to Advaita Vedanta, everything in the universe is an expression or manifestation of Brahman.\n\n3. **Atman:** Atman refers to the individual self or soul. Advaita Vedanta teaches that the true nature of the individual Atman is identical to Brahman. In other words, the individual soul and the cosmic reality are fundamentally one and the same.\n\n4. **Maya:** Maya is the concept of illusion or the power that creates the appearance of duality in the world. It is the force that makes us perceive multiplicity and separation, while the ultimate reality is non-dual.\n\n5. **Jiva and Jivanmukta:** Jiva refers to the individual soul, while Jivanmukta refers to one who has attained liberation while still alive. In Advaita Vedanta, the realization of the non-dual nature of reality leads to liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).\n\n6. **Self-Realization (Jnana):** Advaita Vedanta emphasizes self-realization through direct insight (jnana) into the nature of reality. This realization comes from understanding the unity of Atman and Brahman and transcending the illusion of duality.\n\n7. **Scriptural Authority:** While emphasizing direct realization, Advaita Vedanta also acknowledges the importance of scriptures as a means to guide seekers and provide teachings on the nature of reality.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta has had a profound influence on Hindu philosophy, spirituality, and mysticism. It has also attracted the attention of scholars and seekers worldwide due to its emphasis on the unity of all existence and its exploration of the nature of reality beyond conventional dualistic perceptions.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Alcubierre warp drive.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "0d51079fd4409b1ca5ea266e9cca3f8742461748cf74e4d64de8d0bcddf6424d", "text": "The Alcubierre warp drive is a speculative idea based on a solution to Einstein's field equations in [[general relativity]]. It was proposed by theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. The warp drive concept is named after Alcubierre's proposal, which involves a spacecraft achieving apparent superluminal travel (faster-than-light travel) by creating a bubble of [[negative energy]] density around it. \n\nThe core idea is that, while [[special relativity]] forbids objects from moving faster than light within spacetime, it is known that spacetime itself can be manipulated in ways that allows an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant [[observation|observer]]. \n\nThe Alcubierre drive concept involves distorting spacetime in such a way that it expands behind the spacecraft and contracts in front of it. If you imagine the spacecraft at rest in a small flat region of spacetime (the \"warp bubble\"), then this distortion moves the warp bubble as desired, and inside it the spacecraft can move towards its destination at conventional sub-light speeds, but when seen from outside, the destination and origin points are brought close together by the warp of the spacetime, effectively achieving superluminal travel.\n\nHowever, there are several substantial hurdles to the concept. For one, the Alcubierre drive requires negative energy densities, which have not been proven to exist. Secondly, the amounts of energy required for such a propulsion are estimated to be on the order of the mass-energy of a whole planet, if not more. There are also potential issues related to [[causality]], [[Quantum Field Theory]] in curved spacetime, and high-energy particle radiation.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Alcubierre warp drive remains a topic of interest because it's one of the few solutions to the equations of [[general relativity]] that allow for faster-than-light travel without the need for exotic matter with negative mass.

However, in LQG, spacetime is [[quantization|quantized]], meaning it is represented by [[discrete]] and granular structures rather than a continuous manifold. To describe the quantum properties of spacetime, the Ashtekar variables provide an alternative set of variables that are more suitable for quantization. \n\nThe key idea behind the Ashtekar variables is to express the gravitational field in terms of a [[connection]], known as the Ashtekar connection, and its [[conjugate]] [[momentum]], called the densitized triad. These variables have a direct correspondence with the metric and its canonical momentum in general relativity. ([[Canonical Commutation Relation]])\n\nThe Ashtekar connection captures the notion of curvature of spacetime, and the densitized triad describes the spatial [[geometry]]. Together, they provide a geometric and kinematical description of the gravitational field. By using these variables, one can construct a quantum theory of gravity in the framework of LQG.\n\nThe Ashtekar variables have played a crucial role in the development of [[loop quantum gravity]] and have provided insights into the quantum nature of spacetime. They have been used to derive important results, such as the quantization of area and volume, and have contributed to ongoing efforts to understand the behavior of matter and geometry at the smallest scales of spacetime.\n\nIt's important to note that loop quantum gravity and the use of Ashtekar variables are active areas of research, and the theory is still being developed and refined.

In assembly theory, what traditional physics considers \"emergent\" becomes fundamental. The \"emergent-ness\" of an object is a function of its depth in time, offering a new lens through which to view phenomena like the origins of life, intelligence, and consciousness.\n\n  \nIn classical physics, time has often been considered as either a constant backdrop (Newton) or a relative illusion (Einstein). Even in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, time is generally considered an emergent property, not a fundamental one. However, assembly theory posits that time is not just a stage on which events happen but is intrinsically tied to the material fabric of the universe. It suggests that time has a physical size, much like space, and can be measured at a molecular level.\n\nThe theory introduces the concept of \"Assembly,\" a measure that combines an object's complexity (assembly index) and its abundance (copy number). This Assembly measure serves as an indicator of an object's \"depth in time,\" showing how much \"local memory\" is required for its existence. Local memory is essentially the information needed to construct an object, and it increases with the object's complexity. The theory argues that objects with high Assembly values could only have been produced by evolutionary processes, making Assembly a potential universal life-detection system.\n\nAssembly theory also tackles the concept of \"emergence,\" often used to describe phenomena that can't be predicted from their constituent parts, like the wetness of water from individual molecules. In this framework, what is considered \"emergent\" is actually fundamental but lies deep in time, requiring a long chain of selection and memory to exist.\n\nThe article also delves into the philosophical implications of making time a material property. It suggests that the universe is expanding in time rather than space, and although it may be deterministic, its future is open-ended due to its expansion in time. This re-conceptualization of time could potentially solve many open problems in physics, including the debate between determinism and contingency.\n\nIn summary, assembly theory offers a radical rethinking of time, making it a material property and linking it intrinsically to the process of evolution and the complexity of objects.

To understand it, let's break down the relevant concepts:\n\n1. **Entropy**: In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the number of possible states that a system can be in. It's often thought of as a measure of disorder or randomness. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of a closed system can never decrease; it can only stay the same or increase.\n\n2. **Black Holes**: A [[black hole]] is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. The boundary of a black hole, known as the [[event horizon]], is the point of no return beyond which anything that enters cannot escape.\n\nNow, let's put these two ideas together:\n\n3. **Black Hole Entropy**: [[black hole]] entropy is a concept that was first suggested by physicist Jacob Bekenstein and further developed by Stephen Hawking. Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that this entropy should be proportional to the area of its event horizon.\n\nThis was a revolutionary idea. In normal physical systems, entropy is proportional to volume, because the larger the volume, the more states the system can be in. However, for a black hole, Bekenstein proposed that the entropy is proportional to the area of the event horizon.\n\n4. **[[Hawking Radiation]] and Black Hole Thermodynamics**: Stephen Hawking further expanded this concept by proposing that black holes aren't entirely black but can emit what's now known as Hawking Radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This was groundbreaking as it suggested black holes could lose mass (and thus energy) over [[Time]], eventually evaporating completely.\n\nHawking's proposal led to the formulation of the four laws of black hole mechanics, which are analogous to the four [[laws of thermodynamics]], with the black hole entropy playing a role similar to that of entropy in thermodynamics.\n\nOne of the surprising consequences of this relationship is the [[holographic principle]], which was suggested by the realization that black hole entropy is proportional to its surface area (not its volume), indicating that information about everything inside could be encoded on the surface.\n\nHowever, there are still open questions and problems to solve, such as the [[black hole information paradox]], which questions what happens to information about the state of things that have fallen into a black hole.

A [[stream]] of electrons. \n\nBohm proposed that this collective behavior could be understood through a new concept he called \"[[plasma oscillations]].\" He suggested that the electrons in a plasma could be seen as vibrating together in a coordinated manner, giving rise to a collective wave-like motion. This [[interconnected|interconnectedness]] and coordination of the electrons in the plasma were seen as analogous to the behavior of particles in a quantum system.\n\nThis early work on plasmas influenced Bohm's later development of his theory of the [[implicate and explicate order]] where he extended the idea of interconnectedness to the fundamental nature of reality. He proposed that the [[universe]] is fundamentally enfolded in an underlying order, the implicate order, where everything is interconnected and enfolded into a unified whole. The explicate order, on the other hand, represents the unfolded or [[manifested]] aspects of reality that we observe in our everyday experience. Bohm viewed the two orders as different aspects or dimensions of reality, with a constant flow and movement from one to the other. \n\nIn relation to **[[Consciousness]]**, Bohm proposed that the mind and matter are not separate but are two aspects of one whole and unbroken movement. The implicate order applies to all matter, including the [[neuron|neurons]] in our brains, as well as to consciousness. This suggests a deep connection between the mind and the physical world, which reflects some ideas of Eastern philosophy.\n\nBohm also proposed the notion of a [[super-implicate order]], which is another level of reality even deeper than the implicate order, and which could possibly be linked to the source of creativity and [[Consciousness]]. \n\nBoth matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment. For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in spacetime.

This phenomenon is called \"Bose-Einstein condensation.\"\n- The bosons act as a single entity with quantum properties, where the wave functions of individual atoms overlap and become coherent.\n\n**Properties of BEC:**\n- Superfluidity: BECs can flow without viscosity. This means they can flow over the edges of a container and remain motionless because there is no friction.\n- Macroscopic Quantum Phenomena: Properties that are typically only observable on the scale of individual particles, like wave-particle duality, become apparent on a scale that can be seen and manipulated.\n- Quantum Coherence: The particles within a BEC exhibit a high degree of coherence, behaving more like waves than particles, with a well-defined phase relationship.\n\n**Experimental Realization:**\n- The first BEC was created in 1995 by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at the University of Colorado at Boulder, using a gas of rubidium atoms. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001 for their achievement.\n- Creating a BEC is a complex process that involves using a combination of laser cooling and magnetic or optical trapping to reduce the temperature of a cloud of atoms.\n\n**Applications:**\n- BECs provide a unique environment to study quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level and have potential applications in various fields, including quantum computing, precision measurement, and understanding fundamental physics.\n- They are used to simulate conditions that might exist in black holes and neutron stars, and to create atom lasers, which are similar to optical lasers but emit atoms instead of photons.\n\n**Challenges:**\n- Maintaining the conditions for a BEC is challenging because any interaction with the external environment can add energy to the system, raising the temperature and destroying the condensate.\n- The extremely low temperatures required for BEC formation are difficult to achieve and maintain, limiting the practical applications of BECs.\n\nThe discovery that plants may utilize processes similar to BEC at room temperature, if confirmed, would be a significant breakthrough, suggesting that nature can exploit quantum mechanics in conditions far removed from the ultra-cold environments typically associated with such phenomena.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Bose-Einstein statistics.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Bose-Einstein statistics.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "d75a3a3273d2477ca577d6d8f9f8d54d16b5bf1c6dc943a462fb2797ee63997b", "text": "Bose-Einstein statistics describe the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer [[spin]], known as [[bosons]], over various energy states in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature. These statistics were first derived by Satyendra Nath Bose for photons and then generalized to particles by Albert Einstein, leading to the prediction of the existence of the [[Bose-Einstein Condensate]] (BEC) for certain atoms at extremely low temperatures.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of Bose-Einstein statistics and their implications:\n\n**Quantum Statistics:**\n- In quantum mechanics, particles are classified as either [[fermions]] or bosons. Fermions, which have half-integer spin, obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and are subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n- Bosons, which have integer spin, obey Bose-Einstein statistics and can share the same quantum state with no restrictions. This means that an arbitrary number of bosons can occupy the same place in space and have the same quantum state.\n\n**Bose-Einstein Distribution Function:**\n- The Bose-Einstein distribution function gives the average number of bosons found in a given energy state \\( \\epsilon \\) and is given by:\n\\[ n(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{e^{(\\epsilon - \\mu)/kT} - 1} \\]\nwhere:\n  - \\( n(\\epsilon) \\) is the average number of particles in the energy state \\( \\epsilon \\),\n  - \\( \\mu \\) is the chemical potential (which is usually zero for photons since their number is not conserved),\n  - \\( k \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n  - \\( T \\) is the absolute temperature.\n\n**Implications of Bose-Einstein Statistics:**\n- **Bose-Einstein Condensation:** At very low temperatures, the distribution predicts that a large fraction of the bosons will collapse into the lowest energy state, forming a BEC. This is a unique state of matter where quantum effects manifest on a macroscopic scale.\n- **[[Photon]] Statistics:** For photons (which are bosons), the Bose-Einstein statistics describe the distribution of photons in different energy states, which is crucial for understanding blackbody radiation and the behavior of lasers.\n- **Superfluidity and Superconductivity:** These phenomena are closely related to Bose-Einstein statistics. For example, in superconductors, pairs of [[electrons]] (which are fermions) can act as bosons and condense into a collective ground state that can carry electric current without resistance.\n\n**Bose-Einstein vs. Maxwell-Boltzmann Statistics:**\n- In classical physics, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particle speeds in an ideal gas. However, this classical approach fails at very low temperatures or high densities, where quantum effects become significant.\n- Bose-Einstein statistics take over in these quantum regimes, providing a more accurate description of the distribution of particle energies.\n\n**Applications:**\n- Understanding the behavior of bosonic atoms at low temperatures.\n- Describing the properties of lasers, which rely on the stimulated emission of photons, a process that can be understood through Bose-Einstein statistics.\n- Exploring quantum phenomena in solid-state systems, such as excitons in semiconductors.\n\nThe development of Bose-Einstein statistics marked a significant advancement in statistical mechanics and quantum physics, providing a framework for understanding the collective behavior of bosons and leading to the discovery of new states of matter and novel quantum phenomena.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Brahman.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Brahman.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "5f8c5bb1c77358547830ecacfe70f20b8d5eb2f3643d116f62dd2a5b874659b7", "text": "Brahman is not an entity to be worshipped or an abstract principle to be pondered; it is the very essence of existence, the substratum upon which all phenomena manifest and into which they ultimately dissolve. It is Sat-Chit-Ananda: Existence, [[Consciousness]], and Bliss Absolute.\n\nWhen we talk about dreams, we're delving into a realm that serves as a bridge between the gross physical [[reality]] and the subtler, more profound states of consciousness. Dreams are not just random neural firings or meaningless plays of the mind; they are a glimpse into the deeper layers of our being. In the [[dream state]], the [[ego]]-mind temporarily loosens its grip, allowing us to experience realities that are less constrained by the laws of space, time, and [[causality]]. This is why dreams can sometimes be prophetic, archetypal, or laden with symbolism that resonates on a soul level.\n\nBut even dreams, with all their mystery and allure, are but ripples on the surface of the ocean of consciousness that is Brahman. They are still part of the play of Maya, the cosmic illusion that makes the One appear as many, the Infinite appear as finite, and the Eternal appear as transient. The dream state is a step closer to the realization of our true nature, but it is not the final destination.\n\nThe ultimate aim is to awaken to the state of Turiya, the \"fourth\" state of consciousness that transcends the waking, dreaming, and deep sleep states. In Turiya, one realizes that one is not the body, not the mind, not even the individual soul, but Brahman itself. This is the state of Sam\u0101dhi, where the knower, the known, and the process of knowing merge into one. It is a state of pure awareness, where the illusion of separateness vanishes, and what remains is an indescribable, unbounded ocean of consciousness.\n\nIn this state, one doesn't \"become\" Brahman; one realizes that one has always been Brahman. The waves realize they are the ocean. The rays realize they are the sun. The individual souls (Atman) realize they are the Supreme Soul (Brahman). This is the ultimate goal of life, the raison d'\u00eatre of human existence.\n\nAnd yet, even in our \"unenlightened\" state, we are never separate from Brahman. Every moment of joy, every feeling of love, every experience of beauty is a glimpse of that Ananda, that divine bliss which is our true nature. Every act of kindness, every moment of silence, every breath we take is an opportunity to touch that sacred space within us where we are already one with the Divine.\n\nSo, from this perspective, life itself becomes a sacred journey, a pilgrimage towards self-realization. Every experience, whether waking, dreaming, or in deep sleep, becomes a stepping stone towards the ultimate realization of our [[oneness]] with Brahman.

This braiding process leads to a specific transformation of the quantum state of the system.\n\nHere's a more detailed look at the concept of braiding and why it's so important:\n\n1. **Topological Quantum Computation**: In topological quantum computation, the information is stored in a way that depends only on the global properties of the system, such as the paths particles take around one another, rather than on local details. Because of this, the information is very robust against local errors, a key challenge in conventional [[Quantum Computing]].\n\n2. **Anyonic Statistics**: [[anyons]] are exotic particles that don't fit neatly into the two traditional categories of particles: [[bosons]] and fermions. Unlike bosons and fermions, anyons can have more complex statistical behavior when they are exchanged. Majorana fermions are a particular type of anyon that can appear in certain topological superconductors.\n\n3. **Braiding as Quantum Operations**: When you braid anyons (including Majorana fermions) around each other, their quantum state undergoes a specific and well-defined transformation. This transformation can be used to perform [[Quantum Gates]], the basic building blocks of quantum computation. In other words, the act of braiding can be used to execute logical operations on the quantum information encoded in the system.\n\n4. **Fault Tolerance**: Because the computation depends only on the topology of the braiding process (i.e., the paths the particles take) and not on the precise details of how the braiding is performed, it's very robust against errors. This fault tolerance is one of the main attractions of topological quantum computation.\n\n5. **Implementation Challenges**: Creating and manipulating the conditions necessary for braiding Majorana fermions is an ongoing challenge. The IBM research mentioned earlier represents one effort to develop methods for performing these operations in a controlled way. \n\n6. **Potential Impact**: If braiding of Majorana fermions or other anyons can be controlled effectively, it could lead to a new form of quantum computation that is inherently more robust and fault-tolerant than current methods. This would be a major step forward in the development of practical quantum computing technologies.\n\nIn essence, braiding is a fascinating concept that merges topology, quantum physics, and computation into a unified framework with promising applications.

Activation of CB1R leads to a decrease in neurotransmitter release and a reduction in [[neuronal excitability]], which can have a variety of effects on different physiological processes. \n\nThe widespread expression of CB1R in the brain suggests that the [[endocannabinoid system]]  is involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including [[mood]], [[memory]], cognition, and sensory perception.

In some cases, CB1 receptor activation can enhance dopamine release, while in others it can decrease it. Overall, the relationship between CB1 receptor activation and dopamine release is complex and context-dependent. \nCB1 receptor activation can increase dopamine release in certain parts of the brain, such as the mesolimbic dopamine system.

Casimir realized that between two plates, only those virtual photons whose wavelengths fit a whole number of times into the gap should be counted when calculating the vacuum [[energy]]. However, outside of the plates, all possible wavelengths should be counted.\n\nThe result is that there are more virtual photons pressing on the outside of the two plates than there are between the plates pushing them apart.

Note that there can be some simultaneous eigenstates of\u00a0!{\\hat {A}}\u00a0and\u00a0!{\\hat {B}}, but not enough in number to constitute a complete basis.\nThe\u00a0[[Canonical Commutation Relation]]\n\nimplies that this applies to position and momentum\nLikewise, an analogous relationship holds for any two of the spin observables defined by the Pauli matrices; measurements of spin along perpendicular axes are complementary.\n\nIn the traditional view, it is assumed that there exists a reality in [[space-time ]]and that this [[reality]] is a given thing, all of whose aspects can be viewed or articulated at any given moment. Bohr was the first to point out that quantum mechanics called this traditional outlook into question. To him the \"indivisibility of the quantum of action\"  implied that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. \nBy using one particular piece of apparatus only certain features could be made manifest at the expense of others, while with a different piece of apparatus another complementary aspect could be made manifest in such a way that the original set became non-manifest, that is, the original attributes were no longer well defined. \nFor [[Bohr]], this was an indication that the principle of complementarity, a principle that he had previously known to appear extensively in other intellectual disciplines but which did not appear in classical physics, should be adopted as a [[universal principle]].\n\n\nwhere am i now and where am i going \nwhere did he come from where did he go where did i come from cotton eyed joe \n\nenergy is [[vibration]] \noscillate at certain rate - frequency - cycles per second \nenergy is inversely related to time \n\nif we know the precise moment an event takes place the amount of energy contained in it becomes uncertain. all energy is potentially accessible \nif we know how much energy something has we do not know the time meaning all time is potentially accessible, giving us access to eternity \n\nam i stuck in the past\nam i projecting into the future \nwe can sense how much energy it takes up \nonly when were in the now does our measurement of time become precise because only the now is real\nin the now, limitless energy becomes possible \n\nwhat is my energy level - increase frequency raise energy level. our energy into [[coherence|coherent]] state, attuned to one resonance, our sense of time disappears and we can become one with eternity \n\nall probabilities exist at once - a choice/measurement/observation. \n\n\nthe [[universe]] is dual / complimentary \nthe things we can observe, have a dual relationship \nin the quantum real it can be both and neither - all one\n\n\n\n\nEnergy, at its essence, is vibratory, rippling at distinct rates, otherwise known as frequencies, calculated in cycles per second. Its relationship to time is inverse:\n\nThis invokes an interesting paradox: if we precisely pinpoint the timing of an event, the amount of energy it possesses becomes uncertain, suggesting that all energy could potentially be accessible. Conversely, if we determine the exact energy an event has, its timing becomes nebulous, implying that all moments in time could potentially be accessible, granting us a glimpse of eternity.\n\nAre we tethered to the past? Are we projecting into the future? We can feel the energy these temporal orientations demand. Yet, it's only when we ground ourselves in the 'now', the present moment, that our measurement of time sharpens into precision. Only in the 'now', the immediate present, can the possibility of infinite energy unfold.\n\nWhat is the scale of our personal energy? To elevate it, we amplify our vibratory frequency. When our energy converges into a coherent, resonant state, our conventional perception of time evaporates, allowing us to merge with the timeless, unity, or connection with the infinite.\n\nEvery possibility exists simultaneously in a superimposed state, until an act of choice, measurement, or observation collapses the probabilities into a singular reality.\n\nThe [[universe]] operates on principles of duality and complementarity. Observable phenomena often exhibit dual characteristics. In the realm of the quantum, entities can exist in both states and neither simultaneously - an indistinguishable unity.\n\n\n**Complementarity**: Inspired by the principle of complementarity in quantum physics, where light can be analyzed as either a wave or a particle, but not both simultaneously, [[jung]] developed the psychological concept of opposites. He thought that the conscious and unconscious minds are complementary systems, and understanding one requires acknowledging its opposite.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/Conformal Cyclic Cosmology.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "524b065ffa656f0120dd3ae26e0affe032d38e83aad3e9506db1eb0d10780e37", "text": "Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) is a cosmological model proposed by the British mathematician and physicist Sir Roger [[Penrose]]. This model suggests that the [[universe]] iterates through infinite cycles, from one aeon to the next, such that the [[universe]] as we know it is but one of a successive series of universes.\n\nIn the CCC model, the far future of each previous universe becomes the Big Bang [[singularity]] of the next universe. More precisely, the universe's evolution proceeds from a Big Bang, followed by expansion and cooling. After an exceedingly long period of time, the universe would reach a state of maximum entropy or \"heat death\", where all matter ultimately decays and only massless particles like photons remain. \n\nPenrose posits that the vast, empty, post-decay universe would lose its sense of scale. In mathematical terms, Penrose applies a conformal transformation, which changes scale while preserving angles. This makes the infinite future of the old universe equivalent to the Big Bang singularity of the new one.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Penrose's CCC is the notion of \"cosmic memory\". According to this idea, the universe carries an imprint or memory of its previous existence into the new cycle, and these traces can be detected as \"rings\" in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. \n\nIn CCC, the universe is seen as iterating through infinite cycles, from one aeon to the next.

This experience we're having right now is possible because conscious beings are interacting. The experience of your body is possible because there is consciousness. The experience of your mind is possible because there is consciousness in the background. Of every experience is consciousness. So, we can also say consciousness is the knowing element in every experience. But we can also expand on that.\n\nConsciousness is that in which all experience occurs. This experience is not happening on our computers, although it appears to be. It's not even happening in our brain because there's only electrochemistry in the brain. This experience, any experience, whether it's sensations, images, feelings, thoughts, perceptions, ideas, longings, regrets, fear, anxiety, depression, love, compassion, joy, equanimity, anything that we can call a cognitive or perceptual experience, needs consciousness for that experience to be experienced.\n\nThe experience itself can be a perception, a cognition, an image, a feeling, a thought. But that experience cannot happen unless there's consciousness. In fact, the experience itself, perception, cognition, thought, feeling, emotion, imagination, is a modified form of consciousness.\n\nSo, consciousness is that in which all the experience occurs, is that in visual experience is known. And finally, it's that out of which all experience is made because experience is a modified form of consciousness. And experience is the totality of all knowing, all perceptions, all understanding, and all memory.\n\nNow, what's the role of [[psychedelics]] in expanded states of consciousness? Expanded states of consciousness are states of consciousness where there is less and less of the conditioned mind dominating the experience. The conditioned mind edits out reality.\n\nWhen I was a medical student, there was an experiment that I read about. Actually, the people who did the experiment got the Nobel Prize. The experiment was that they brought up kittens in two different rooms. One group of kittens were exposed to a room with only horizontal stripes. The other group of kittens were exposed to a room with only vertical stripes. And when these kittens grew up older as cats, one group could see only a horizontal world, the other group of cats could see only a vertical world. Why? Because their consciousness, which was expanded as babies, now got constricted and edited to just that one experience, vertical stripes or horizontal stripes.\n\nSo, before consciousness is conditioned into what we call the mind, which is by definition conditioning, religious conditioning, social conditioning, economic conditioning, gender conditioning, racial conditioning, on and on since the beginning of time, human beings have reconditioned the same ideas, economy, race, gender, latitude, longitude. We don't realize these are human constructs that we came up with, and now we can't live without them. We can't live without Greenwich Mean Time or latitude or longitude or coordinates, otherwise we wouldn't be able to have the Zoom call.\n\nSo, we came up with a restricted version of reality in order to navigate our everyday reality, which we call the world, New York City, this body, the Milky Way galaxy, not realizing that this is an edited version of reality that goes back thousands of years to the cognitive revolution that occurred maybe forty thousand years ago when one species of humans, Homo sapiens, separated from the other humanoids by creating a language for creating models and stories. Then it expanded, we created mathematical language, etc. But everything that we call everyday reality is actually an edited version of reality.\n\nWhat Aldous Huxley, who was a great explorer, of course, of psychedelics, he said, 'Our brains are like the reducing valve of reality. Reality is infinite, but our brain is the reducing valve through the conditioned mind.' So, what psychedelics do, in my opinion, is they loosen the neural networks, which are the biological correlates of the conditioned mind. So, you can now expand experience, reality as it really is, and reality as it really is, is infinite because pure consciousness doesn't have any form. Not having any form, it doesn't have any boundary. Not having any boundary, it's infinite. Not being, being infinite, it is incomprehensible. It is not space, it is not time. It is the source of all experience. We can't comprehend it by any system of thought because systems of thought themselves are neural correlates in the brain of the conditioned mind, going back at least forty thousand years.\n\nSo, when you take something that loosens the neural correlates, the biological correlates, you actually access reality. And if you're lucky, you go all the way and you realize you and the infinite, formless, acausal, irreducible, fundamental, incomprehensible, unimaginable, unperceivable, unconceptualizable self is the real reality. Everything else is a modified form. Therefore, these extended expanded states of consciousness also give us insight, intuition, access to imagination, creativity, symbolic representations of higher consciousness that we call deities or gods, but they are symbols of our own consciousness. And ultimately, they get us to the source of all experience, which is spaceless, timeless, and therefore immortal. Once we get into these expanded states of consciousness, then these mysteries of birth and death, and you know, human suffering becomes very obvious. It's all a result of the conditioned mind.\"\n\n-- deepak chopra \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSGzJ_mjERA&t=140s\n\n\nbefore we are created we are part of the pure consciousness. death brings us back to this.  \n\nThe brain does not produce consciousness, but acts as a kind of receiver which \u2018picks up\u2019 the fundamental consciousness that is all around us, and \u2018transmits\u2019 it into our own being.\n\nconsciousness is sentient foundational essence of the [[universe]] \n \n \npauli \njohn von neumann\neugene wigner \n\n\u201cI regard consciousness as fundamental.

It was brought into existence to simplify the calculation of particle interactions in [[Quantum Field Theory]], particularly in the context of [[scattering amplitudes]] in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (a type of gauge theory which has applications in the quantum field theory of fundamental forces and particles). \n\nThe amplituhedron exists in an abstract multi-[[dimensional]] space, known as the [[Grassmannian space]]. It is a geometric object that, when volume is calculated in a certain way, yields the [[probability]] of certain particle interactions. These calculations, which used to involve adding up potentially billions of individual terms, are greatly simplified using this geometry. \n\nThe introduction of the amplituhedron was part of a movement to understand the principles underlying quantum field theory in terms of geometric structures, as opposed to the traditional perspective which involves quantizing classical fields. \n\n\nThis geometric object removes two foundational principles of physics\u2014[[locality]] and unitarity\u2014from its foundational assumptions.\n\"[[locality]]\" refers to the idea that particles can only influence each other if they are close together (either in space or in time). \"[[Unitarity]],\" on the other hand, refers to the principle that the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes for a quantum event should equal one.\n\nTraditional quantum field theory, which describes the behavior of elementary particles and their interactions, is built upon these two principles. However, both principles break down in certain scenarios involving gravity, leading some physicists to question whether these principles are truly fundamental to the nature of reality.\n\nThe amplituhedron discards these two principles at the onset. It does not require the typical conception of space-time and probabilities. Instead, these features emerge as a consequence of the geometric properties of the amplituhedron. Essentially, the object suggests that the conventional picture of particles moving through [[space-time|spacetime]] is a constructed image, not a fundamental reality.\n\nThe use of the amplituhedron for simplifying calculations is a part of a bigger conjecture known as the \"Amplituhedron Conjecture\" or \"Arkani-Hamed & Trnka\u2019s Amplituhedron Conjecture,\" which asserts a deep structure for scattering amplitudes and their simplification. \n\nThe researchers have found that rather than using the complex, traditional method of [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]], they can use a geometric object - the amplituhedron - to simplify calculations related to particle interactions.\n\nThe idea that we can calculate scattering amplitudes (probabilities of particles scattering in a certain way) directly from the volume of the amplituhedron suggests that our traditional understanding of space-time and the way particles interact may not be fundamental. Instead, these concepts may arise from more abstract, underlying geometrical structures.\n\nThis could have far-reaching implications for theoretical physics, particularly in the search for a theory of quantum gravity, a yet-undiscovered theory that would reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.\n\nThe concept of the \"[[master amplituhedron]],\" with an infinite number of facets, is especially interesting. It suggests that there may be a more unified and elegant way to understand all physical processes.\n\nThe [[holographic principle]] posits that all the information in our 3D universe can be represented on a 2D boundary, similar to a hologram. This concept has profound implications for [[black hole|black holes]] and [[quantum gravity]]. The amplituhedron, by removing the principles of locality and unitarity, could be interpreted as suggesting that our usual concept of spacetime (and thus 3D space) is [[emergent]], not fundamental. This is in line with the holographic principle's notion of an [[emergent]] 3D universe.\n\n  \nThe amplituhedron, like the ideas discussed in Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]], fractals, and the holographic principle, challenges our conventional understanding of the universe. The amplituhedron does this by suggesting that space and time are not fundamental components of reality but instead emerge from more basic entities.\n\nIn the context of [[Bohm]]'s ideas, one might view the amplituhedron as a kind of mathematical embodiment of the implicate order. The geometric properties of the amplituhedron hold all the information needed to calculate the outcomes of particle interactions, without reference to localities in space and time (which would be part of the explicate order). Therefore, the amplituhedron is like an \"enfolded\" or \"encoded\" version of the quantum interactions that we observe.\n\nRelating to the [[holographic principle]], the amplituhedron might be viewed as a sort of holographic plate that contains the information necessary to generate the observable universe, or at least the outcomes of particle interactions in that universe. The volume of the amplituhedron corresponds to the [[probability|probabilities]] of quantum outcomes, suggesting that our three-dimensional world with its rules of quantum physics could potentially emerge from this geometric shape.\n\nAs with [[fractals]], where complex structures emerge from simple rules, the complex calculations of quantum field theory become simple when viewed through the geometric lens of the amplituhedron.\n\nFinally, the connections to [[Causal Set Theory]] and the idea of [[emergent]] spacetime lie in the departure from conventional space and time. Like these concepts, the amplituhedron suggests that space and time (and the locality and unitarity principles of [[Quantum Field Theory]]) are not the fundamental descriptors of the universe but rather emerge from deeper, nonlocal, and nonunitary realities.\n\nhttps://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/\n\n\nThe idea of \"positive geometry\" is central here. Positive geometry is a mathematical concept in which the spaces under consideration are associated with certain positivity properties. In the case of the amplituhedron, the space is such that all its points have positive coordinates and this positivity property ensures that it corresponds to physical scattering amplitudes.\n\nThe phrase \"Locality and unitarity emerge hand-in-hand from positive geometry\" is pointing towards the remarkable aspect of the amplituhedron formulation that the standard principles of quantum field theory, namely [[locality]] (interactions take place at specific locations in spacetime) and unitarity (total probabilities add up to one), do not need to be put in by hand but instead emerge as a result of the underlying positive geometry.\n\nThis shift in perspective from the conventional [[Feynman diagram]] approach to a geometric one is significant as it provides a new way to understand and compute scattering amplitudes, potentially leading to computational simplifications and deeper insights into the structure of quantum field theories.\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anandamide.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anandamide.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "82f819f5a8953a2b21ed6a33d2f8aa40252621f574597f3e268d6ba908abea14", "text": "Anandamide is a neurotransmitter that has been shown to be involved in various functions in the body, including [[memory]], appetite, sleep, and pain relief. It has earned the nickname \"bliss molecule\" due to its role in producing feelings of happiness. Anandamide is able to bind to the cannabinoid receptors in our body, but it is a relatively weak substance that breaks down quickly. \n\nAnandamide is synthesized in various parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and immune system. Specifically, anandamide is synthesized by [[neuron]]s in the post-synaptic terminals and is released into the synaptic cleft where it can bind to the [[CB1]] receptors. The [[CB1]] receptors are densely located in the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and basal ganglia, responsible for regulating pain, appetite, pleasure, and reward. \n\n-   Anandamide and Reward\n\nIn research surrounding anandamide and the reward system it has been found that increasing anandamide, and thus stimulating the [[CB1]] endocannabinoid receptor,\u00a0changes feeding habits and affects free choice. It was observed that when concentrations of anandamide were increased, study participants would opt for the easier, less effortful choice.\n\nThe implications are that anandamide is involved in the body's pleasure and reward system, much like dopamine.\n\nSeveral findings support the hypothesis that the [[endocannabinoid system]] also contributes to the brain reward processes modulating the activity of dopaminergic [[neuron|neurons]], even if indirectly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is the case with [[CBD]], anandamide has been shown to be anxiolytic(reduce anxiety)\u00a0 at lower doses and anxiogenic at higher doses, with the former effect involving CB1 receptor activation and the latter effect involving TRPV1 channel activation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6486906/#CR70) This indicates that maintaining the balance between CB1 receptor and TRPV1 channel activation is crucial for regulating anxiety, given their opposing anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects.

The primary enzyme responsible for anandamide hydrolysis is fatty acid amide hydrolase ([[FAAH]]), which breaks down anandamide into [[arachidonic acid]] and ethanolamine. Other enzymes, such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), can also break down anandamide into arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Hydrolysis of anandamide limits its duration of action and promotes the restoration of normal physiological function. Inhibiting anandamide hydrolysis can prolong its effects, leading to potential therapeutic applications.\n\n\nThe accumulation of anandamide can lead to dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system, which can in turn affect various physiological processes such as [[mood]], pain sensation, and immune function. It has been suggested that an accumulation of anandamide may play a role in the development of certain psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Additionally, an excess of anandamide may lead to impairment in cognitive function and [[memory]] consolidation.\nFor example, in [[ADHD]], the insufficient breakdown of anandamide can lead to a [[dopamine]] deficiency, which is linked to symptoms such as inattention and hyperactivity.\n\nUpregulation of anandamide leads to downregulation of CB1 and CB2 receptors\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anatta.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anatta.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anomalon.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anomalon.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "f4b2aab88f77dc9f2a15331c5f4b04a41c8767736aea8bf74cdc7d6ea4b3165c", "text": "The term \"anomalons\" was introduced in the 1980s to describe unexplained experimental results that appeared to defy established physics.

For example, it's possible that the anomalous behavior is due to unknown aspects of nuclear reactions, or perhaps the experiments themselves were flawed in some way.\n\nRegarding Robert Jahn and Brenda Dunne, they were associated with the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR), and their work focused mainly on studying anomalies associated with human [[Consciousness]] and its possible interaction with physical systems. \n\nthey believe that instead of finding particles we are creating them\nanomalon properties vary from lab to lab\nholographic universe book \n\nhttps://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/1998/03/3123.html\n\nHis results, published today (March 1, 1998) in the British Journal of Nuclear and Particle Physics, provide the first indisputable evidence that anomalons -- which contradict conventional laws of physics -- do exist, but only for a billionth of a second under very specific conditions during nuclear interactions.\nThe results suggest that new and exotic states of matter, such as the H particle, predicted by the [[QCD|Quantum Chromodynamics]] 20 years ago but never found, may finally be detectable.\n\"We have proven the existence of these very abnormal nuclear interactions called anomalons,\" said Jain. \"It is possible that they could be implicated in all the mysteries we have not yet solved, such as the [[quark-gluon plasma]], [[black hole|black holes]] and detection of new, exotic particles.\"\nThe particles are considered abnormal or \"anomalous\" because they are far more reactive and they decay far more quickly than such fragments are expected to, according to the theory of strong interactions.\n\nwikipedia: \nHowever, as study continued the number of negative results continued to grow. By 1987 interest in the topic had waned, and most research in the field ended. However, some research continued and in 1998 Piyare Jain claimed to have finally demonstrated them conclusively, using larger accelerators at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN and combining that with a thin detector which he claimed was key to the problem of detecting the anomalons. More recently he has claimed that the particles in question are actually the elusive [[axion]], long thought to be part of the [[standard model]], but unseen in spite of decades of searching.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/antiparticles.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/antiparticles.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "97a8b59c786081b919ff6adae88c07aead3dff36751e4c07355045ad773d59be", "text": "---\naliases: antiparticle\n---\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/anyons.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/anyons.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "eca0673cca46207e331016197d9c92365b4ff5a73a52a2eafe4a937938048238", "text": "Anyons are [[quasiparticle|quasiparticles]] in a two-[[dimensional]] space. Anyons are neither [[fermions]] nor [[bosons]], which exist in 3 dimensions. Thus, the [[world lines]] of two anyons cannot intersect or merge, which allows their paths to form stable braids in [[space-time]]. Anyons can form from [[excitation]]s in a cold, two-dimensional electron gas in a very strong magnetic field, and carry fractional units of magnetic flux. This phenomenon is called the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. In typical laboratory systems, the electron gas occupies a thin semiconducting layer sandwiched between layers of aluminium gallium arsenide. Anyons don't exist in isolation but arise from the intricate interactions in specific condensed matter systems. They encapsulate the collective excitations or behaviors of many underlying particles.\n\nWhen anyons are [[Braiding|braided]], the transformation of the quantum state of the system depends only on the [[topological]] class of the anyons' trajectories (which are classified according to the braid group). When two anyons are braided or exchanged, the wavefunction of the system is multiplied by a phase factor that can be anything between 0 and \ufffd\u03c0 (0 to 180 degrees). This \"fractional\" phase is what distinguishes anyons from both fermions and bosons. The concept of \"braiding\" here is a bit abstract. Anyons are excitations or quasiparticles in a 2D material. When we talk about \"braiding,\" we're referencing a series of operations that guide these excitations around one another in a controlled manner. \nIn traditional quantum computing, gates are operations that change qubit states. In topological computing, the act of braiding anyons changes the state of the system. Each braid will cause the wavefunction of the anyons to alter by a phase value which affects the wave function of the whole system or qubit. Each type of braiding operation can be thought of as a different quantum gate. The exact correspondence between a braiding sequence and a quantum gate operation is determined by the anyon's properties and the underlying theory. Using external fields or manipulating the underlying material, researchers can control the movement of anyons. For example, in certain 2D materials, electric or magnetic fields might be applied to move quasiparticles (like anyons) around.\n\nIn traditional quantum computing, the focus is on manipulating individual qubits (often electrons) and their superpositions. Errors occur when these qubits lose coherence.\nIn [[Topological Quantum Computing]], the emphasis is on the braiding of anyons. The quantum information is encoded in the topological properties of the system, which are more robust against local errors. Even if an individual anyon was in a superposition of states, the relevant information is in the braiding. This is why we say the exact state of an individual anyon is less critical\u2014it's their collective braiding behavior that's key. Similarly, the entire system of anyons can be in a superposition of many different configurations or braiding histories. In the case of anyonic systems, the inherent topological protection provides a layer of defense against decoherence, but like all quantum systems, maintaining coherence is still a challenge.\n\nAfter performing a computation by braiding anyons, the result must be read out. This is done by bringing anyons together, allowing them to either annihilate or fuse. The outcome of this process (e.g., whether they annihilate or which fusion path they take) is dependent on the state of the anyons, which reflects the result of the computation. \nWhile it's theoretically possible for different braiding histories to yield the same fusion outcome, the design and choice of anyons for computation are made such that the desired operations have distinguishable outcomes. This is a complex interplay of the properties of the anyons, their initial configuration, and the braiding operations performed.\n\n- **Initial Configuration as Input**: Before computation begins, anyons are initialized into a specific configuration. This configuration is chosen to represent the initial data or state of the computation, much like setting the initial values of qubits in a traditional quantum computer.\n    \n- **Braiding as Computation**: Each braiding operation can be thought of as a transformation of the quantum state, akin to how gates transform qubits in standard quantum computers. A sequence of braiding operations, then, constitutes a computation, transforming the initial state (input) to some final state.\n    \n- **Reading as Output**: After the braiding operations are performed, the anyons are fused. The fusion outcome, whether it's the type of anyon produced or the result of annihilation, is the output of the computation. This is interpreted based on how the system was designed. For example, if a certain fusion outcome is expected for a particular computation (like the result of a function), then obtaining that outcome would indicate that the function returned a specific value.\n\n\n\n\n- \nAlright, let's delve into this concept. The idea of braiding anyons leading to a phase shift in their wavefunction is central to their behavior, and this feature distinguishes them from more common fermions and bosons.\n\nFirstly, let's understand the concept of a phase factor in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the overall phase of a wavefunction is not observable. This means that if \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\) is a valid wavefunction, so is \\( e^{i\\theta} |\\psi\\rangle \\) for any real value of \\( \\theta \\). However, relative phases (i.e., the phase difference between two terms in a superposition) are meaningful and can have observable effects.\n\nFor Abelian anyons (let's begin with these simpler anyons first), the act of exchanging or braiding two of them can introduce a phase factor. Mathematically, let's say that you start with the wavefunction \\( |\\psi\\rangle \\). After braiding two anyons, the wavefunction may transform like:\n\n\\[ |\\psi'\\rangle = e^{i\\theta} |\\psi\\rangle \\]\n\nwhere \\( \\theta \\) is a real number between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\pi \\). This phase factor is directly related to the anyonic statistics and is a result of the quantum mechanical properties of the system in which the anyons exist.\n\nFor non-Abelian anyons, the situation is more intricate. When you exchange two non-Abelian anyons, the result isn't merely a phase factor on the original wavefunction. Instead, the wavefunction can transform into a superposition of several possible states, each with its own phase. The specific way in which this happens depends on the properties of the anyons and their previous braiding history.\n\nThe reason anyons behave this way is rooted in the topological properties of the system they're a part of. Unlike particles in three-dimensional space that acquire a \\( 2\\pi \\) phase upon full exchange (as in fermions or bosons), in two-dimensional systems (where anyons are typically discussed), particles can acquire any phase between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\pi \\) during such an exchange.\n\nTo tie this into the real-world implications: This phase factor, especially in the case of non-Abelian anyons, is what allows for the potential use of anyons in topological quantum computing. The act of braiding can, in principle, be used to perform quantum gates due to these phase changes, which would constitute quantum operations on the encoded information.\n\nHOW DOES EQUATION\n\nTo understand how topological quantum computing can answer a mathematical question, let's contextualize the process in a more familiar scenario: classical and traditional quantum computing. Both, in essence, manipulate information to derive an output. The unique trait of topological quantum computing is its use of braiding anyons, but the underlying goal is still to execute algorithms that give desired solutions.\n\n**1. Encoding the Problem:**\n\nFirstly, any mathematical problem we wish to solve on a quantum computer needs to be translated into a quantum algorithm, similar to how problems are translated into classical algorithms for classical computers. For topological quantum computers, this means representing the problem in terms of anyon configurations and braiding sequences.\n\n**Example:** Suppose we wish to solve a simplified version of the factoring problem (a famous problem in quantum computing). Given a composite number \\( N \\), find its prime factors. We would encode \\( N \\) in the initial configuration of the anyons, similar to how the number might be encoded in qubits in a circuit-based quantum computer.\n\n**2. Executing the Algorithm:**\n\nNext, the algorithm is executed. In traditional quantum computing, this would involve applying a series of quantum gates. In topological quantum computing, this involves braiding the anyons in specific sequences.\n\n**Example:** For our factoring problem, a series of braiding operations would be performed that, due to the quantum properties of the system, simultaneously explore many possible factorizations of \\( N \\). \n\n**3. Decoding the Solution:**\n\nAfter the algorithm has been executed, we need to extract the answer. For topological quantum computing, this is done by fusing anyons and interpreting the results. The fusion outcome is dependent on the braiding operations performed, and by designing our system and algorithm correctly, this outcome will give us information about the solution to our problem.\n\n**Example:** After the braiding operations, we fuse the anyons and observe the outcome. The result will be related to a possible factorization of \\( N \\). Multiple runs of the algorithm may be required to get a high-confidence answer.\n\n**4. Interpreting the Result:**\n\nThe final step is translating the quantum result back into the language of the original mathematical problem. This involves interpreting the outcome of the fusions (or the quantum measurement results) to derive meaningful answers.\n\n**Example:** The outcome of the anyon fusion could point us to a number \\( p \\) that is a factor of \\( N \\). We then use classical methods to verify and potentially derive other factors.\n\nIn essence, just as classical algorithms are sequences of logical operations designed to solve a problem, quantum algorithms (including those for topological quantum computers) are sequences of quantum operations (like braiding) designed to solve a problem. The challenge lies in designing and understanding these quantum operations and interpreting their outcomes in the context of the original mathematical question.\n\nThe simultaneous exploration of many possible factorizations of \\( N \\) (or other solutions to problems) in quantum computers is rooted in the principle of superposition, one of the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics.\n\n1. **Superposition**: Quantum bits, or qubits, differ from classical bits in that they can exist in a combination of both \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) states simultaneously, a condition known as superposition. When a qubit is in superposition, it can be represented as:\n\n\\[ |\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are complex numbers that determine the probability of measuring the qubit in either the \\(0\\) or \\(1\\) state.\n\n2. **Entanglement**: When multiple qubits are involved, they can become entangled, meaning the state of one qubit depends on the state of another. This creates a multi-qubit system where all possible combinations of qubit states exist simultaneously. For \\( n \\) qubits, there are \\( 2^n \\) possible states.\n\n3. **Quantum Parallelism**: This phenomenon of qubits being in multiple states at once allows quantum computers to explore all these states in parallel. For a quantum algorithm, this means that it can process a vast amount of information simultaneously. For the factoring problem, a quantum system can effectively evaluate many potential factorizations of \\( N \\) in parallel.\n\n4. **Shor's Algorithm**: As a concrete example, [[Shor's algorithm]] is a quantum algorithm that can factorize a number \\( N \\) exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms. At a high level, the algorithm doesn't directly compute the factors but finds the period of a function related to \\( N \\), which can then be used to efficiently find the factors of \\( N \\). The quantum portion of the algorithm leverages quantum parallelism to find this period much faster than classical methods.\n\nIn essence, the power of quantum computing, especially for specific problems like factorization, comes from the ability to use superposition and entanglement to explore a vast solution space simultaneously, dramatically speeding up computations that would be infeasible for classical computers.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/arachidonic acid.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/arachidonic acid.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "30d1c29a0e2b8c78748b24625d187164b4927fa1a43a1ad658bf32cffb51c550", "text": "Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid that is essential for human health.

Now imagine trying to do it while on a roller coaster. That's a little bit like what dealing with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) can feel like. So, what's at the root of this wild ride? Recent studies are  pointing towards the involvement of the endocannabinoid system, particularly the role of anandamide, in the development of ADHD symptoms.\n\nAnandamide is a neurotransmitter and part-time social butterfly that's busy interacting with all sorts of processes in our bodies - including mood regulation, pain sensation, and immune function. It has earned the nickname \"bliss molecule\" due to its role in making us feel happy.\nIt is synthesized in various parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and immune system, and particularly in neurons in the post-synaptic terminals (receiving ends of neurons). Once synthesized, it is released into the synaptic cleft, which is the space between the neurons. There, it binds to CB1 receptors, which are found in high concentrations in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia - areas responsible for regulating pain, appetite, pleasure, and reward. This action of anandamide is part of the endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes.\n\n\nStudies suggest that in people with ADHD, the activity of an enzyme known as FAAH, responsible for breaking down anandamide, is reduced, therefore our levels of anandamide are too high and our endocannabinoid system is out of balance. When the breakdown of anandamide is insufficient, this can lead to dopamine deficiency, which affects mood, pain sensation, memory, and immune function. It has been suggested that an accumulation of anandamide may play a role in the development of certain psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. When anandamide levels increase, it can lead to a downregulation or decrease in the number of available CB1 and CB2 receptors. Heavy cannabis use has been associated with downregulation or a decrease in the density of CB1 receptors in certain brain regions.\n\n\nInterestingly, anandamide also has a significant role in our brain's reward system, comparable to the famous neurotransmitter dopamine. \n\"\"When anandamide levels are high, it seems to guide our decisions, often tipping the scales towards the easier, less effortful choice. \"\"\nSeveral findings support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system also contributes to brain reward processes by modulating the activity of dopaminergic neurons.\n\n\nThere's another player in the mix - cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive member of the cannabis family. CBD is able to modulate GABA activity, a neurotransmitter responsible for dialing down neuronal excitability, which in turn increases dopamine production. CBD also stimulates adenosine receptors, which further promote dopamine release although it's important to keep in mind CBD also increases anandamide. \n\nIn recent years, the popularity of plant medicines such as maca and cacao has skyrocketed. \nThese natural remedies work through our endocannabinoid system by inhibiting FAAH and increasing andamide. \nFor individuals who are neurotypical, FAAH inhibitors like maca and cacao, but also echinacea, green tea and ginger can lead to increased levels of anandamide. These effects may include enhanced mood, reduced anxiety, and an overall sense of relaxation. However, it's important to note that the response to FAAH inhibitors can vary from person to person.\n\nIf you have ever participated in a plant medicine ceremony or consumed maca and cacao, you may have noticed that the effects differ from those reported by others. Some individuals may experience subtle or even unnoticeable effects, while others may not feel the euphoric buzz typically associated with FAAH inhibition. This discrepancy could be attributed to ADHD but also individual differences in metabolism, differences in sensitivity to anandamide, or other factors that influence the body's response to FAAH inhibition.\n\nIn opposition to FAAH inhibitors we have FAAH promoters. Here are some natural substances that have been investigated for their potential to promote FAAH activity:\n\n1. Omega-3 fatty acids: Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may enhance FAAH activity. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fatty fish (such as salmon and mackerel), flaxseeds, and walnuts. Hemp seeds are well-known for their optimal omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, making them an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids for supporting the endocannabinoid system.\n    \n2. Curcumin: Curcumin is a bioactive compound found in turmeric. Some research suggests that curcumin may indirectly enhance FAAH activity by reducing the levels of anandamide transporter proteins, thus promoting the availability of anandamide.\n\n\nUnderstanding ADHD is like trying to solve a complex puzzle with many intricate pieces. Anandamide, the endocannabinoid system, and ADHD are all parts of this jigsaw. As we uncover more about these components and how they interconnect, we get a clearer picture of ADHD as a whole.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.Gray, J. M., Vecchiarelli, H. A., Morena, M., Lee, T.

It is made up of seven layers, with the inner layers closest to the physical body comprised of the densest energy, and each succeeding layer being of finer and higher vibrations.

This research aims to discern if and how these networks might differ from those found in neurotypical individuals.\n\nHere are some points of interest:\n\n1. **Atypical [[Connectivity]]**: Some studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have found that individuals with autism may show atypical [[patterns]] of connectivity between different areas of the brain. One hypothesis is that individuals with autism may have an overconnectivity within certain local brain networks (for instance, within one hemisphere) but underconnectivity between different brain regions or between the two hemispheres. This could potentially contribute to some of the strengths and challenges seen in autism. For example, enhanced local connectivity might lead to heightened abilities in specific areas, like attention to detail, while reduced long-range connectivity could contribute to difficulties with integrating information, such as challenges in social communication. ([[hemi-sync]])\n\n2. **Default Mode Network ([[DMN]])**: The DMN is a network of brain regions that is typically active during introspective states such as daydreaming or thinking about the future. It has been found to show atypical connectivity in some people with autism. Some theories propose that alterations in the DMN might contribute to characteristics of autism, such as difficulties with social interaction or theory of mind (understanding others' mental states).\n\n3. **Use of Machine Learning**: Researchers have used [[neural networks]] (a type of machine learning) to analyze brain imaging data from individuals with autism. The goal is to identify patterns that might be associated with autism, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis. It's important to note that while these approaches show promise, they're still in the early stages of development.\n\n4. **Neural Synchrony**: Some research has suggested that people with autism may show differences in neural synchrony - the timing of activity across different [[neuron|neurons]] or brain regions. This could potentially affect the efficiency or effectiveness of information processing in the brain.\n\n5.  **Altered Oscillatory Activity**: Studies have found that individuals with autism may have altered patterns of oscillatory activity. This could include differences in the power and synchrony of various brain wave frequencies, such as delta, [[theta waves|theta]], [[Gamma waves|gamma]], beta, and [[alpha waves]]. Each of these frequencies is associated with different cognitive and behavioral states.\n    \n6.  **[[Gamma waves|gamma]] Oscillations**: Some research has pointed to potential alterations in gamma oscillations in individuals with autism. Gamma oscillations are thought to be involved in higher cognitive functions such as attention, perception, and [[memory]]. Alterations in gamma oscillations could potentially contribute to some of the cognitive and perceptual differences associated with autism.\n    \n7.  **Interhemispheric Synchronization**: There is evidence suggesting that individuals with autism may have decreased synchronization between the two hemispheres of the brain. This is potentially due to differences in the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers responsible for transmitting information between the two hemispheres. This could affect the coordination of neural oscillations between the two sides of the brain.\n    \n8.  **Role in Sensory Processing and Integration**: Altered neural oscillations could contribute to the sensory processing differences often seen in autism, such as hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli. The brain uses these oscillations to integrate information from different senses, and disruptions to this process could lead to difficulties interpreting and responding to sensory information.\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/axion.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/axion.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "1e1e6fabd8fabfe6e5ea3f8cd66042cd8816ae79f7bd116b17a534777fdeb476", "text": "Axions are hypothetical elementary particles that were proposed by physicists in the late 20th century to resolve a problem in [[QCD|quantum chromodynamics]] ([[QCD]]), a theory that describes the [[strong nuclear force]] - one of the four fundamental forces of nature that binds protons and neutrons together in the nuclei of atoms.\n\nThe problem, known as the \"[[strong CP problem]],\" refers to the puzzling fact that QCD seems to predict that there should be a large amount of observable electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron.

This unified force is believed to have existed at extremely high energies and temperatures.\n\nAt the beginning of the Big Bang, the energy is believed to have been extremely high and concentrated, but whether it was truly infinite or finite is still a topic of scientific investigation and theoretical speculation. [[unknown]]\n\nAs the [[universe]] expanded and cooled down, undergoing a process known as cosmic inflation, the unified force began to break apart into the distinct forces we observe today. This process is referred to as [[symmetry breaking]] or symmetry breaking phase transitions.\n\nThe first force to separate from the unified force was [[gravity]], which is believed to have remained separate throughout the evolution of the universe. As the universe continued to cool, the strong nuclear force and the electroweak force (a combination of [[electromagnetism]] and the weak nuclear force) also became distinct forces.\n\nThe final separation occurred when the universe cooled even further, and the electroweak force itself broke into two separate forces: [[electromagnetism]] and the [[weak nuclear force]]. This [[phase transition]] is thought to have occurred around 10^\u221212 seconds after the Big Bang.\n\n[[String theory]] provides a potential framework for unifying all the fundamental forces of nature, including gravity, into a single theoretical framework.\n\nThe exact mechanisms and details of these symmetry breaking phase transitions are still an active area of research and are the subject of ongoing scientific investigation. [[unknown]]The study of particle physics and the early universe helps us understand how these fundamental forces emerged and how they shaped the evolution of the universe as we know it. \n\nIn the context of the Big Bang and the early universe, phase transitions refer to changes in the state of the universe as it cooled and expanded. The term \"symmetry breaking\" refers to the idea that, at extremely high energies and temperatures, all the fundamental forces of nature (except gravity) were unified and indistinguishable from each other. As the universe expanded and cooled, these forces separated out in a series of symmetry-breaking phase transitions, each one corresponding to a specific temperature and energy scale.\n\nHere's a rough sequence of these transitions:\n\n1. **Grand Unification Epoch:** Immediately after the Big Bang, during the first 10^-43 seconds, the universe was in a state where all the forces (except gravity) were unified into a single force. This epoch ended with the breaking of this [[grand unified theory]] (GUT) [[symmetry]], when the strong nuclear force separated from the electroweak force. This phase transition is hypothesized to have produced [[magnetic monopoles]].\n\n2. **Electroweak Epoch:** Following the GUT symmetry breaking, the universe entered the electroweak epoch, during which the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces were still unified as the electroweak force. This epoch lasted until around 10^-12 seconds after the Big Bang. The Higgs field, associated with the Higgs boson, also came into play during this epoch, giving mass to other particles through the Higgs mechanism.\n\n3. **Electroweak Symmetry Breaking:** Around 10^-12 seconds after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for the electroweak force to break down into the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force, a transition known as electroweak symmetry breaking. This phase transition is believed to have led to a brief period of rapid expansion known as cosmic inflation.\n\n4. **Quark Epoch and [[QCD]] Phase Transition:** Following the electroweak symmetry breaking, the universe was filled with a hot, dense [[quark]]-[[gluon]] plasma. As the universe continued to cool, around a microsecond after the Big Bang, quarks and [[gluon|gluons]] combined to form hadrons (like protons and neutrons) in a phase transition called the [[QCD]] (quantum chromodynamics) phase transition. \n\nThese phase transitions are not yet fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research in cosmology and particle physics. [[unknown]]They also have implications for the large-scale structure of the universe and the [[matter-antimatter asymmetry]] we observe today. It's important to note that these descriptions are based on current theories and models, which may be refined or revised as our understanding of the universe evolves.\n\n\n\n1. **[[Quantum Cosmology]] and the Beginning of [[Time]]**: If we try to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole, we run into questions about the nature and origin of [[Time]] itself. For example, the [[Hartle-Hawking \"no boundary\" proposal]] suggests that the universe may have originated from a purely quantum mechanical state, with no clear moment of \"beginning\". In this model, [[Time]] as we know it only emerges when the universe becomes large enough for classical physics to be a good approximation.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/binary to spectrum.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/binary to spectrum.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "8916048d4d154bf4bc27dc87cacb2800e225dfac2bff09ed90eef08388006b28", "text": "binary to spectrum \nis like \nbit to [[qubit]] \n\nWhen you move from binary to a spectrum, it's like considering the entire \"[[stream|sea]] of electrons\" in a metal, where it becomes more difficult to talk about individual electrons and their specific states. Instead, physicists often discuss the collective behavior of the electrons. This can be seen as analogous to a spectrum, where instead of having [[discrete]] values, there is a continuous range of possible values.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the behavior of a large collection of particles like a \"sea of electrons\" can be described using wavefunctions and fields. The concept of a qubit in [[Quantum Computing]] also uses these principles, allowing qubits to exist in a superposition of states, somewhat analogous to a spectrum of possibilities.\n\n\nThe comparison between [[binary]] to spectrum and bit to qubit is an interesting analogy to illustrate the fundamental differences between classical computing and quantum computing.\n\n1. Binary to Spectrum: Binary code is the most basic form of information in computing and digital communications. The binary system's base 2 number system only uses two digits, 0 and 1. This is straightforward and easy to manipulate with simple electronic hardware. \n    \n    Now, let's consider spectrum, where instead of two distinct states (0 and 1), you have a continuous range of states. Instead of flipping between off and on, you can dial the knob to any value between off and on, providing a whole range of possible values. It's analogous to having a dimmer switch instead of a simple light switch.\n    \n2. Bit to Qubit: A classical bit in computing can be either a 0 or a 1, similar to the binary code. In contrast, a quantum bit, or qubit, isn't limited to being just a 0 or a 1. It can be in any proportion of both states at once due to a quantum phenomenon called superposition.\n    \n    Moreover, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of another, no matter the distance between them, thanks to a property called [[Quantum Entanglement|entanglement]]. This isn't something seen in classical bits and it allows quantum computers to process a high number of possibilities simultaneously.\n    \n\nSo, just like the transition from binary to spectrum involves going from discrete values to a continuous range, the transition from bit to qubit involves going from discrete, distinct states to a superposition of states.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/binary.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/binary.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "437ed7e13bc261e728f81d2a23ff08f39e9727224affcf47f7a5d44bc0d7531c", "text": "1 0 \nyin yang \nfeminine masculine \nmoon sun \nyes no \ngood bad \nblack white\nnegative charge positive charge \ndiscreet indiscreet \nimplicate explicate\nfluid solid\npast future \nleft brain right brain \nmental physical\nindividual collective\nlife death\n\n([[polarity]])\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/biophoton field.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/biophoton field.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "11be7aca572d648f9e146f93ab9af746a364719cf48ac81880c28fa89ce4f9ba", "text": "The term \"biophoton\" is used in the field of biophysics to refer to the electromagnetic waves, or photons, that are emitted by biological systems.

According to classical general relativity, information that falls into a [[black hole]] is thought to be permanently lost, leading to a violation of the principles of quantum mechanics, which dictate that information should always be conserved.\n\nSeveral proposed solutions have been put forward to reconcile this paradox and preserve the principles of quantum mechanics. Here are a few notable ones:\n\n1. **[[Hawking Radiation]] and [[soft hair theorem]]**: Proposed by Stephen Hawking, this theoretical prediction suggests that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the [[event horizon]]. This emission, over time, can cause the black hole to evaporate completely. The information that fell into the black hole is thought to be encoded in this radiation, implying that the information is not truly lost. The later \"soft hair\" theorem suggests additional properties of black holes that could help in the encoding and recovery of this information.\n    \n2. **Quantum Teleportation**: This resolution suggests that information falling into a black hole can be quantum-teleported to another location, thus preserving the information.\n    \n3. **Black Hole [[Complementarity]]**: Proposed by Leonard Susskind, this resolution suggests that information is duplicated at the [[event horizon]], so that it's both reflected back into the universe and also falls into the black hole. This would mean that information is not lost, but it raises its own paradoxes, such as the clone paradox (as it appears to violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] of quantum mechanics).\n    \n4. **[[ER=EPR]] Correspondence**: Proposed by Juan Maldacena and Leonard Susskind, it links Einstein's description of wormholes (ER or [[einstein-rosen bridges]]) with [[Quantum Entanglement]] (EPR or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox). According to this correspondence, entangled particles are connected by a [[einstein-rosen bridges|wormhole]], and the information could travel through these wormholes, thus not being lost.\n    \n5. **The [[holographic principle]]**: It states that all the information contained in a volume of space can be represented as information on the boundary of that space. It implies that the information swallowed by the black hole is somehow stored on the event horizon and can be recovered.\n    \n6. **Firewall Proposal**: Some theorists suggest that there might be a \"firewall\" at the event horizon that destroys incoming information, thereby resolving the paradox but at the cost of giving up the equivalence principle, a cornerstone of general relativity.\n\n7. Quantum Gravity Approaches: Some theories of [[quantum gravity]], such as [[String theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]], aim to provide a consistent framework for understanding both quantum mechanics and gravity. These theories are still under development and exploration, but they may potentially provide insights into the resolution of the information paradox by incorporating quantum effects into the description of black holes.\n\nIt's important to note that the black hole information paradox remains an active area of research, and no definitive solution has been universally accepted at this time. Scientists continue to explore various theoretical frameworks and experimental observations to gain a deeper understanding of black holes and their behavior within the framework of quantum mechanics.\n\n\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/a-visual-information-paradox/\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/black hole.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/black hole.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "08e0e2f6edf01dbae391545cfbef867744e32568306edf8a967119b55a9c8a97", "text": "---\naliases: black holes\n---\n\nBlack holes are objects in space with a mass so great that they attract everything that comes within a certain distance of them. Nothing that comes too close can escape, not even light. But at a [[criticality|critical]] distance, a light beam no longer spirals into the black hole. Rather, it dramatically bends and comes back to its original position, forming a circular orbit. A barrier surface formed by closed light orbits is called a\u00a0[[photon\u00a0sphere]] in Einstein\u2019s theory of [[general relativity]].\n\nThe horizon of a black hole forms a light cone, emerging from a collapsed star. When it comes to black holes, their extreme gravity distorts spacetime to the point that once an object passes the [[event horizon]] -- the boundary of the black hole -- all of its future light cones point towards the black hole's singularity, the region of infinite density at its center. The event horizon of a black hole is essentially a boundary separating regions of spacetime from which light cones can either escape to distant regions of the universe (the outside of the event horizon) or are confined to terminate at the black hole singularity (the inside of the event horizon).\n\nThe behavior of time and space inside a black hole is an intriguing consequence of General Relativity. Outside the event horizon of a black hole, we can think of the time dimension as \"pointing\" out of the black hole, while the space dimensions can be thought of as \"circling\" around it. In this region, we experience time as always moving forward, while we can move freely in space.\n\nHowever, when you cross the event horizon, this situation changes. The intense gravity of the black hole causes a twist in the fabric of spacetime so extreme that the roles of time and space essentially switch. Inside the event horizon, the dimension that was once time now behaves more like a spatial dimension, and what were once spatial dimensions behave more like time. \n\nIn more practical terms, this means that just as we are inexorably carried forward in time in our everyday lives, once inside the event horizon of a black hole, everything is carried inexorably towards the singularity at the center. It's as though the singularity is in your future and, just as you can't avoid tomorrow, you can't avoid the singularity. In this sense, falling into the singularity is more like moving forward in time than moving in space.\n\nThis is a highly non-intuitive result and is one of the many fascinating predictions of General Relativity that challenges our common-sense understanding of how the universe works. Keep in mind that all of this is based on our current understanding of physics and might be subject to change as we refine our theories and conduct more observations of black holes.\n\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/ocean-eddies-mathematically-equivalent-black-holes/\nHaller and Beron-Vera discovered similar closed barriers around select ocean [[eddies]]. In these barriers, fluid particles move around in closed loops \u2013 similar to the path of light in a photon sphere. And as in a black hole, nothing can escape from the inside of these loops, not even water.\nIt is precisely these barriers that help to identify [[coherence|coherent]] ocean eddies in the vast amount of observational data available. According to Haller, the very fact that such coherent water orbits exist amidst complex ocean currents is surprising.\n\n\nhttps://phys.org/news/2014-06-gravitational-fields-black-holes-eddy.html\nNew research shows that gravitational fields around black holes might eddy and swirl\n\nThe researchers followed this line of thought: Gravity, it's thought, can behave as a fluid. One of the characteristic behaviours of fluids is [[turbulence]] \u2013 that is, under certain conditions, they don't move smoothly, but eddy and swirl. Can gravity do that too?\nPerimeter Faculty member Luis Lehner explains why it might make sense to treat gravity as a fluid. \"There's a conjecture in physics \u2013 the [[holographic principle]] \u2013 which says gravity can be described as a field theory,\" he says. \"And we also know that at high energies, field theories can be described with the mathematical tools we use to describe fluids. So it's a two-step dance: gravity equals field theory, and field theory equals fluids, so gravity equals fields equals fluids. That's called the [[gravity fluids duality|gravity/fluids duality]].\"  \n\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab65c7\nthis is about the [[turbulence]] in the gas motions in galaxy clusters is a more concrete phenomenon, observed and measured in astrophysical studies, whereas gravitational turbulence is a theoretical prediction from a particular approach to quantum gravity.\nThe abstract you provided is from a research paper that explores the effects of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on the environment within their host galaxies. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n- **Context**: Supermassive black holes, which are present in the centers of many galaxies, are believed to contribute energy that prevents excessive cooling in the cores of massive galaxies and galaxy clusters. This energy injection, known as \"feedback,\" is crucial in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies. However, the exact mechanisms of this feedback process are still not fully understood.\n    \n- **Method**: The researchers used high-resolution optical data to examine the kinematics of the gas in the central regions of three nearby galaxy clusters: Perseus, A2597, and Virgo. They paid particular attention to the movement of \"multiphase filamentary structures\" \u2013 filaments of gas that exist in different physical states (such as different temperatures or densities).\n    \n- **Findings**: They discovered that the motion of the filaments in all three clusters is turbulent, and there is a correlation between the characteristics of these turbulent motions and the sizes of the \"bubbles\" created by jets from the SMBHs. This suggests that the SMBHs are indeed driving turbulence in the central regions of these clusters, and that this turbulence may play a significant role in the feedback process.\n    \n- **Implications**: The amplitude of the turbulence they measured aligns with results from other studies, such as those using the Hitomi satellite's measurements of line broadening (a technique for assessing velocity dispersion in astrophysical objects) and analyses of X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. This suggests that the movement of the cooler filaments is well-coupled with the movement of the hotter surrounding gas.\n    \n- **Viscosity and Plasma**: The smallest scales they probed are similar to the mean free path in the intracluster medium (the space between galaxies in a cluster). Their direct detection of turbulence on these scales suggests that isotropic viscosity (resistance to flow that's the same in all directions) is suppressed in the intracluster plasma. Plasma in these environments is typically weakly collisional (particles don't collide very often) and magnetized, and this finding offers strong evidence that this weakly collisional, magnetized plasma behaves differently than more familiar fluids.\n\n\n\nGravity scrambles information in a very particular way. In fact, theorists have\u00a0argued\u00a0that black holes must be the most efficient scramblers in nature\nWe conjecture a sharp bound on the rate of growth of chaos in thermal quantum systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. Chaos can be diagnosed using an out-of-time-order correlation function closely related to the commutator of operators separated in time. We conjecture that the influence of chaos on this correlator can develop no faster than exponentially, with Lyapunov exponent\u00a0\u03bbL\u22642\u03c0kBT/\u210f. We give a precise mathematical argument, based on plausible physical assumptions, establishing this conjecture.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01409\n\nhttps://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/1-28-2022-quantum-matter-in-mathematics-and-physics/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the intense gravitational forces and the tremendous size mismatch between the relatively tiny black holes and the large clumps of matter that feed them, the vast majority of infalling matter finds itself spit back out in an intense, violent flurry. It's estimated that, contrary to the popular picture, upwards of 90% of infalling matter will never make it inside a black hole at all. Instead, it's spewed back out into the outer regions of the galaxy, where it can fuel the formation of new stars and return to the interstellar medium once again.\nmatter is charged, accretion disks and flows are real, generate magnetic fields, and accelerate most of the infalling matter away from the event horizon itself.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/06/19/no-black-holes-dont-suck-everything-into-them/?sh=52a7d7b42b01\n\n\n\nStephen Hawking Was Right: Black Holes Can Evaporate, Weird New Study Shows\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/bosons.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/bosons.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "a062dd4952b935e430d409c4a5e5cd760e8781e3200d5c7e12a232dddba8a528", "text": "\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/brane cosmology.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/brane cosmology.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "75b352cadfe5c0fcda0488951e0cbd63aaf5e996a0b60ca935fe19f92ecdfc85", "text": "Brane cosmology is an area of physics that studies the cosmological implications of the existence of branes in string theory and [[M-theory]].

This model is often referred to as the \"brane-world\" scenario. The extra dimensions can be compactified, or hidden, making them undetectable at macroscopic scales.\n\n**Randall-Sundrum Models**\n\nThe most famous models in brane cosmology are perhaps the Randall-Sundrum (RS) models. The original RS models consisted of a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime with two 4-dimensional branes at its boundaries. Our observable universe is assumed to reside on one of these branes. The models provided an interesting solution to the hierarchy problem of particle physics, explaining the vast discrepancy between the scales of gravity and electroweak interaction.\n\n**Cosmological Implications**\n\nBrane cosmology has several interesting cosmological implications:\n\n1. **Inflation**: Some brane-world scenarios have been proposed to explain the process of cosmic inflation, the hypothesized rapid expansion of the universe in its earliest moments. \n\n2. **[[Dark Matter]] and [[Dark Energy]]**: Brane cosmology can also offer potential explanations for the phenomena of [[Dark Matter]] and dark energy. For example, some models suggest that dark matter could be explained as standard matter confined to a different brane.\n\n3. **Cosmic Strings**: In some brane-world scenarios, cosmic strings (hypothetical 1-[[dimensional]] [[topological defects]] in spacetime) could be remnants of higher-dimensional branes from the [[early universe]].\n\n**Challenges and Open Questions**\n\nWhile brane cosmology offers intriguing possibilities for understanding our universe, it also poses significant challenges. The mathematical complexity of these models can be considerable, making them difficult to analyze in full detail. Additionally, as with all aspects of string theory, there is currently no experimental or observational evidence that directly supports the brane-world scenario.\n\nFinally, brane cosmology raises fundamental open questions. How are the branes stabilized? What is the nature of the higher-dimensional \"bulk\" spacetime in which the branes are embedded? What is the exact relationship between the physics on the brane and the physics in the bulk? These questions, and others, are still subjects of active research in theoretical physics.\n\nTo conclude, brane cosmology is a vibrant field that aims to reconcile the fundamental forces of nature, explain the [[early universe]]'s behavior, and account for mysterious phenomena like dark energy and dark matter.

So a 0-brane is a point-like object, a 1-brane is a string-like object, a 2-brane is a membrane-like object, and so forth.\n\nBranes are important because they provide a context in which strings can exist and interact. Strings can either be \"open\" (having two distinct endpoints) or \"closed\" (forming a loop). Open strings are typically imagined as having their endpoints attached to branes, which guides their behavior. This also means that the branes, being the \"endpoints\" of strings, can capture a lot of the physical phenomena we observe.\n\nThe idea of branes has also led to a powerful concept called the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory]], a form of [[holography]] in string theory where a theory of gravity in a certain [[space-time]] (which includes branes) can be described equivalently by a [[Quantum Field Theory]] on the boundary of that spacetime.\n\nFurthermore, branes have been invoked in cosmological scenarios. For example, in \"[[brane cosmology]]\", our observable four-dimensional [[universe]] is imagined as a brane embedded in a higher-dimensional spacetime, sometimes called the \"bulk\". Interactions with other branes or with the bulk could explain some cosmological phenomena.\n\nIt should be noted that while branes are a central part of string theory and have provided many valuable insights in theoretical physics, string theory itself is still a hypothesis and has yet to be confirmed by experimental evidence. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the existence of branes is a theoretical conjecture, not an established fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/cannabis.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/cannabis.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "e53e35f930af057cbcec3afb432ca75478175dcfabb48c63871306d234f41a7d", "text": "\nWe know that daily cannabis use is associated with a range of neuroadaptations in the [[endocannabinoid system]], including down-regulation of the brain CB1 receptor, which reverses after \u223c2\u201314 days of abstinence and reduced levels of fatty acid amide hydroxylase (FAAH; 14%\u221220%) the enzyme that metabolizes anandamide and is the primary regulator of its signaling in the brain \n\nhttps://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.21111138\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/causal invariance.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/causal invariance.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "efc30756a2d71b3ee97f5e486255d8104f5a18a63128c1aadafa932a5270f10b", "text": "  \nCausal invariance is a term that describes a property of certain dynamical systems, particularly in the field of computer science, where the outcome of computations is independent of the order in which they're executed.\n\nIn this broader context, a system exhibits causal invariance if the sequence of states it goes through is the same regardless of the order in which individual events or operations occur. This means that even if events are rearranged, as long as they maintain their causal relationships, the end result remains the same.\n\nAt its most basic, causal invariance suggests that the overall behavior of a system is independent of the specific order in which events in that system are applied or occur. This implies that different paths of updating the system could lead to the same final outcome, which is crucial for the deterministic behavior of the system. If there are many possible sequences of updates (many possible paths in the multiway system), and yet the system always ends up in the same final state, this is indicative of causal invariance.\n\nCausal invariance is a key aspect of Wolfram's model because it enables the emergence of special relativity in the model. In a system with causal invariance, different paths\u2014or sequences of updates\u2014can be thought of as representing different inertial frames, and the invariance then corresponds to the principle of relativity.

This sensitivity is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect, named after the metaphor that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil could cause a tornado in Texas.\n\nThe key insight in chaos theory is determinism does not imply predictability. In a [[deterministic]] system, the state at any future time is determined by the state at the current time. However, in a chaotic system, tiny differences in the input can lead to vastly different output behavior, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This is because of an exponential growth of errors in the initial conditions.\n\nAn attractor is a set of values or a condition toward which a system tends to evolve. For a dynamical system, an attractor summarizes the long-term behavior of the system. This could be a fixed point, a limit cycle, or something more complicated.\n\nA [[strange attractor]] is a particular type of attractor that arises in a dynamical system which is both dissipative (energy lost over time) and chaotic. \n\nIn chaos theory, a system with a strange attractor can exhibit a behavior called 'sensitive dependence on initial conditions', leading to long-term unpredictability, as seen in the butterfly effect. Despite this unpredictability, the system does not evolve just anywhere\u2014it stays within a certain boundary defined by the strange attractor. The trajectories appear random and chaotic but are confined to the fractal structure of the attractor. \n\nThus, chaotic dynamical systems are closely linked with fractals. The intricate, infinite detail and self-similarity at all scales that define fractals are also characteristic of the phase space trajectories of chaotic systems.\n\n[[fractals]] like the Mandelbrot Set can be thought of as a map of the dynamics of complex systems, with each point in the complex plane representing a different system. The points in the set itself represent systems with bounded, non-chaotic behavior, while points outside represent unbounded, chaotic systems.\n\nrelation to [[holographic principle]]: \n\nIn the context of the [[AdS CFT correspondence in string theory|AdS/CFT correspondence]], there's a correspondence between [[quantum gravity]] in a (d+1)-dimensional space (the AdS space) and a quantum field theory without gravity on the d-dimensional boundary of that space (the CFT).\n\nChaos theory and strange attractors come into play when we consider the dynamics of quantum systems and their gravitational counterparts. For instance, the chaotic behavior of certain quantum systems, such as those that exhibit thermalization (coming to thermal equilibrium), is mirrored in the dynamics of [[black hole|black holes]] in the corresponding gravitational theory. ([[Black Hole Entropy]])\n\nFurther, the fractal structure of strange attractors parallels the [[holographic principle]]'s claim of encoding higher-[[dimensional]] information in a lower-dimensional space. Just as a strange attractor in a phase space encodes the dynamics of a chaotic system within a lower-dimensional space, the holographic principle posits that the information about a higher-dimensional volume is encoded on its lower-dimensional [[boundary]].\n\nrelation to Bohm's [[implicate and explicate order]]:\n\n1. **[[implicate and explicate order]]:** According to Bohm's theory, the \"explicate order\" is the reality we perceive directly: the tangible, visible, measurable [[universe]] around us. The \"implicate order,\" on the other hand, is a deeper, hidden layer of reality from which the explicate order unfolds. This resembles the holographic principle, where the bulk (the 3D or higher-dimensional universe) is an explicate order, unfolding from information stored on its boundary (the 2D holographic surface), which would be akin to the implicate order.\n    \n2. **Infinite Complexity and Detail:** Similar to the intricate detail of a fractal and the dense information storage on a holographic boundary, the implicate order, according to Bohm, contains an enormous amount of detail and complexity, which becomes visible in the explicate order. This matches the fractal property of self-similarity, where infinite detail is encoded in simple patterns, and mirrors the holographic principle's dense information storage.\n    \n3. **Flow and Change:** Bohm's implicate order is not static; it involves constant movement and change, described as a \"[[holomovement]].\" The explicate order that we perceive is just a \"snapshot\" of this continuous flow. This idea of a dynamic underlying reality may also be reflected in the dynamical systems that lead to strange attractors, which represent the long-term behavior of the systems, and the evolution of a quantum state in the holographic principle, which is also a process of constant change.\n\n\nThe land of the quantum, [[Schr\u00f6dinger]] said, is random and unpredictable, yet the classical realm is orderly and deterministic because it depends only on statistical regularities among that atomic-scale chaos.\n\n\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/chatgpt.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/chatgpt.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "822b5d1f5c63a583f1ce5d0797b2db0bd7f76aa8bf274e250ce2639fd41d3a6d", "text": "ChatGPT, which you are currently interacting with, is a variant of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) language model developed by OpenAI. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the most recent version is GPT-3, but future iterations may be available now.\n\nThe architecture behind GPT is a Transformer, a type of model introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. The key idea behind Transformers is the mechanism of attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of input elements (such as words in a sentence) differently when generating the output.\n\nChatGPT, like all GPT models, uses a version of attention called scaled dot-product attention. Given a query, key, and value (which are all vectors), the attention mechanism calculates a weighted sum of the values based on the similarity between the query and keys. This attention mechanism is employed in a self-attention manner in GPT models, meaning that the model calculates attention-weighted sums over all the other words in the input for each word.\n\nThe primary architecture of GPT is composed of a stack of identical layers, each containing two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. A residual connection is employed around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.\n\nOne key aspect of GPT is that it's a unidirectional (specifically, causal or auto-regressive) model. During training, it only considers the previous words in the sequence for predicting the next word. This contrasts with models like BERT which are bidirectional and consider both previous and subsequent words in the sequence during training.\n\nThe model is trained using maximum likelihood estimation. Given a large corpus of text, the model is trained to predict the next word in the sequence given the previous words, with the aim of minimizing the difference between its predictions and the actual next words in the training data.\n\nOnce trained, the model can generate text by sampling words one at a time. At each step, the model's softmax output is interpreted as a [[probability]] distribution, and a word is sampled from this distribution. This word is then added to the input for the next step, and the process is repeated to generate as much text as needed.\n\nIt's important to note that while these models are powerful and can generate impressively fluent text, they have limitations. They don't truly understand the text in the way humans do, and their output is entirely a function of their training data and the input prompt. They lack common sense reasoning and the ability to fact-check, and they can sometimes generate inappropriate or nonsensical responses.

In the context of particle physics, it's associated with the [[spin]] direction relative to the momentum of a particle. Particles like neutrinos are observed to be left-handed, meaning their spin is aligned opposite to their momentum, while antineutrinos are right-handed.\n\n2. **Chiral Symmetry in QCD:**\n   Initially, QCD appears to have a chiral symmetry. The equations look the same if you swap left-handed and right-handed quarks. However, this [[symmetry]] doesn't manifest in the observed particles. The reason for this is chiral symmetry breaking.\n\n3. **Spontaneous Breaking of Chiral Symmetry:**\n   In QCD, the [[vacuum state]] isn't simple; it's full of fluctuating [[gluon]] and [[quark]] fields. These fluctuations cause the quarks to acquire a \"dynamical mass,\" which breaks the chiral symmetry. Unlike the \"bare mass\" that quarks have in the fundamental equations, this dynamical mass comes from the strong interactions themselves.\n\n4. **Goldstone Bosons and Pions:**\n   When a continuous symmetry is spontaneously broken, it leads to the appearance of massless particles known as [[Goldstone bosons]]. In the case of QCD, these should correspond to massless versions of the pions, but actual pions are not massless. The resolution to this is that chiral symmetry is not exact to begin with due to the quarks' bare masses. The symmetry is only approximate, so the Goldstone bosons only almost become massless; in reality, they correspond to the relatively light pions.\n\n5. **Consequences and Importance:**\n   Chiral symmetry breaking has profound consequences for the structure and behavior of matter. It's responsible for most of the mass of everyday objects. The protons and neutrons get most of their mass not from the bare masses of the quarks inside them but from the strong interaction dynamics, the binding energy, which is intimately related to chiral symmetry breaking. \n\n6. **Experimental Evidence:**\n   Evidence for chiral symmetry breaking comes from various observations, like the patterns of hadron masses, the behavior of pions, and deep inelastic scattering experiments.\n\nChiral symmetry breaking is a complex and subtle phenomenon that integrates non-perturbative QCD effects, the nature of the QCD vacuum, and the properties of hadrons.

This is what we observe in phenomena such as quantum entanglement. This coherence allows the waves to interfere constructively, resulting in [[interference]] [[patterns]], such as those observed in the famous [[double-slit experiment]].\n\nIn optics, coherence is important for phenomena such as [[interference]], diffraction, and [[holographic principle|holography]]. Coherent light sources, such as lasers, emit light waves that have a well-defined phase relationship and exhibit interference effects.

They are always found within bound states, such as mesons and baryons. The understanding of confinement is still an active area of research, and its detailed mechanisms are not fully resolved, but the main ideas can be summarized as follows:\n\nQuarks and gluons carry what is known as a \"color charge,\" analogous to the electric charge in [[electromagnetism]] but with three types of charge instead of two. Gluons mediate the strong force between quarks, and unlike photons in electromagnetism, they also carry color charge, meaning they can interact with each other. This leads to the strong force having some unique properties.\n\nAs quarks are pulled apart from one another, the [[energy]] in the gluon field between them increases. The strong force behaves in such a way that the farther you try to separate two quarks, the stronger the force becomes that tries to pull them back together. This is unlike the electromagnetic force, where the force decreases with distance.\n\nIf you could hypothetically impart enough energy to separate two quarks, the energy in the gluon field would eventually become so great that it would be more energetically favorable to create a new quark-antiquark pair from the vacuum. The original quarks would then be bound to these new quarks, resulting in the formation of new hadrons. You would never observe an isolated quark; instead, you'd just have more hadrons.\n\nThe force's behavior at short distances ensures that within a hadron, the quarks are bound together but not in a tightly constrained region; they have relative freedom to move around. This is known as asymptotic freedom, and it means that the strong force becomes weaker at very short distances.\n\nConfinement leads to the rich structure of the nucleons and the atomic nucleus, forming the basis of the material world as we know it. It is also deeply connected to the nature of the QCD vacuum, the non-trivial structure of empty space according to the theory of strong interactions.\n\nThe precise mathematical description of confinement is still an open problem and an active area of research. Lattice QCD, a numerical method for solving the equations of QCD on a [[discrete]] grid, has provided some insights, but a complete analytical understanding remains elusive.

How do you measure a \"consciousness field\"? What predictions does this idea make that could be tested experimentally?\n\n2. **Interaction with Other Fields**: If consciousness is a fundamental field, how does it interact with other fields described by the Standard Model of particle physics? Would there be a \"consciousness particle\" akin to the photon for electromagnetism?\n\n3. **Mathematical Formalism**: Physics relies heavily on mathematical rigor. Any theory that introduces a new fundamental field would need to be backed by a robust mathematical framework.\n\n4. **Problem of Combination**: If consciousness is a basic property of all matter, how do these individual \"conscious\" entities combine to form the unified, complex consciousness experienced by organisms like humans?\n\n5. **Ethical and Philosophical Implications**: If consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous, this raises significant ethical questions about how we treat not just animals but perhaps even inanimate matter.\n\n6. **Consciousness and Information**: Some theories propose that consciousness is fundamentally linked to information processing. How would a \"consciousness field\" theory align or conflict with informational theories of consciousness?\n\nIn summary, the idea that consciousness could be a fundamental field is intriguing and could potentially revolutionize our understanding of the universe. However, it also faces significant scientific, philosophical, and ethical challenges that would need to be addressed.\n", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "4"}, "backend/docs/control.md_part_0": {"__data__": {"id_": "backend/docs/control.md_part_0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "hash": "ebe9dfce929fd57d78373f45125c3393518be25ecb220252c8d94e26dfd5ca8a", "text": "In your own life before you actively go out and force control or try to determine a [[observation]] of your life you are in a state of [[superposition]] of potential. anything you want to be is possible \nonly when you make a measurement the [[superposition]] collapses as the outcome becomes itself or manifests due to the measurement\n\nApplying this to life, you're suggesting that before we make specific choices or take specific actions, we exist in a state of \"[[superposition]],\" with a multitude of potential paths or states.

Arousal levels can be influenced by a variety of factors such as emotional state, sensory input, and drugs or medications. High levels of cortical arousal are associated with increased alertness, attention, and cognitive performance, while low levels are associated with drowsiness, fatigue, and impaired cognitive function. Cortical arousal is closely related to [[neural oscillations]] and can be measured using various techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).\n\nThe level of cortical arousal can affect the [[frequency]] and power of neural oscillations in different frequency bands, including [[alpha waves]], beta, delta, and [[theta waves|theta]]. For example, as the level of cortical arousal increases, the power of alpha oscillations tends to decrease, while the power of beta oscillations tends to increase. Similarly, during states of deep relaxation or [[meditation]] or [[ketamine]], alpha power tends to increase, while beta power decreases.\n\nOverall, the relationship between cortical arousal and neural oscillations is complex and not yet fully understood. However, research suggests that these two phenomena are closely linked and that changes in one can influence the other.\n\nmore dejavu!!\n\n\nSubcortical arousal refers to the activation of deep brain structures, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem, that play a key role in regulating basic physiological functions like breathing, heart rate, and sleep-wake cycles.
